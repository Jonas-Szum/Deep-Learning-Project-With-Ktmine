obtains or generates pertaining to said response, provided that such complaint or recall is relevant to a Kit purchased from CELLSCRIPT.
CELLSCRIPT will have the right to contest to Argos about any complaint or recall that Argos attributes to a Kit purchased from
CELLSCRIPT. Additional procedures for complaint/recall reporting and responses will be as are set forth in a Quality Agreement.</P>
