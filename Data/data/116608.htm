This Agreement shall be binding upon the Company and any successors and assigns of the Company. Neither this Agreement nor any
right or obligation hereunder may be assigned by the Executive. The Company may assign this Agreement and its right and obligations
hereunder, in whole or in part. For purposes of this Agreement, successors and assigns shall include, but not be limited to, any
individual, corporation, trust, partnership, limited liability company, or other entity that acquires a majority of the stock or

require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise) to all or substantially all
of the business and/or assets of the Company to expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to
the same extent that the Company would be required to perform if no such succession had taken place. Without limiting the foregoing,
unless the context otherwise requires, the term &ldquo;Company&rdquo; includes all Affiliates of the Company.</P>
