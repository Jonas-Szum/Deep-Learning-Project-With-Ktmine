under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, on Form S-1, Form S-3 (if available) or any successor form thereto (each a&nbsp;&ldquo;<I><U>Registration
Statement</U></I>&rdquo;). Each request for a Registration Statement shall specify the approximate number of Stock Consideration

receipt thereof) deliver notice of such request to all other holders of Stock Consideration who shall then have 30 days from the
date such notice is given to notify the Company in writing of their desire to be included in such registration. The Company shall

Statement to be declared effective by the Commission as soon as practicable thereafter. The Parent shall not be required to effect
a Registration more than 3 times for the holders of Stock Consideration as a group; <U>provided</U>, that a registration statement

effective registration statement. The Parent shall only be required to maintain the effectiveness of a Registration Statement
for a two (2) year period commencing on the effectiveness of the initial Registration Statement. If any SEC Guidance sets forth
a limitation on the number of securities permitted to be registered on a particular registration statement (and notwithstanding
that the Parent used diligent efforts to advocate with the SEC for the registration of all or a greater portion of Stock Consideration),
the number of Stock Consideration to be registered on such registration statement will be reduced on a pro rata basis with such
other securities being registered on the applicable registration after as full an allocation as possible has been afforded for
the securities for which the registration statement has been filed. For purposes of this <U>Section 6.16</U>, SEC Guidance means
(i) any publicly-available written guidance, or rule of general applicability of the SEC staff, or (ii) oral or written comments,
requirements or requests of the SEC staff to the Company in connection with the review of a Registration Statement.</P>
