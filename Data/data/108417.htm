<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I></I></B>This Amended and Restated Joint Development and Supply Agreement (this <B><I>&#147;Agreement&#148;</I></B>) is entered into as of April __, 2008
(the <B><I>Effective Date</I></B>) by and between ViewRay Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (<B><I>&#147;ViewRay&#148;</I></B>), and 3D&nbsp;Line GmbH, a German corporation (<B><I>&#147;3D&nbsp;Line&#148;</I></B>).<B><I> </I></B></P>

in the business of developing, manufacturing and selling multi-leaf collimators (<B><I>MLC&#146;s</I></B>). ViewRay is in the business of developing and ultimately commercializing radiotherapy devices.<B><I> </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I></I></B>ViewRay wishes to retain 3D&nbsp;Line to develop a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">60-Leaf</FONT> MLC for integration into the radiotherapy

(the <B><I>&#147;ViewRay System&#148;</I></B>). If 3D&nbsp;Line develops a MLC that meets the specifications established by ViewRay, then ViewRay also wishes to purchase from 3D&nbsp;Line quantities of such MLC&#146;s on an exclusive basis.<B><I>

in ViewRay were not made aware of the existence such Joint Development and Manufacturing Agreement. Accordingly, ViewRay wishes to amend and restate the November&nbsp;13, 2007 agreement to address certain matters not covered by the 2007 Agreement
and to provide each party with additional clarity regarding their rights and responsibilities under this Agreement. 3D&nbsp;Line is also willing to amend and restate the 2007 Agreement to clarify such matters.<B><I> </I></B></P>

hereof, which claim would, but for this Section&nbsp;9.2(a), be submitted to arbitration under Section&nbsp;9.2(b) in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section&nbsp;9.2(b), will, before such submission to arbitration, first be escalated to
the Chief Executive Officer of 3D&nbsp;Line and the Chief Executive Officer of ViewRay for resolution. They will use reasonable efforts to attempt to resolve the dispute through good faith negotiations by telephone or in person as may be agreed and
if they fail to resolve the dispute within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after either party notifies the other of the dispute, and do not mutually agree to extend the time for negotiation, then the dispute will be submitted to arbitration in accordance with
the procedure set forth in Section&nbsp;9.2(b). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(b) Except with respect to Actions by either party seeking equitable or declaratory

the Rules of the International Chamber of Commerce (the <B></B><B><I>&#147;Rules&#148;</I></B><B></B>) as such Rules may be modified by this Agreement, by one arbitrator, who will be agreed upon by the parties. If the parties are unable to agree
upon a single arbitrator within thirty (30)&nbsp;days following the date arbitration is demanded, three arbitrators will be used, one selected by each party within ten (10)&nbsp;days after the conclusion of the
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">30-day</FONT> period and a third selected by the first two within 10&nbsp;days thereafter. Unless the parties agree otherwise, they will be limited in their discovery to directly relevant documents. Responses or
objections to a document request will be served twenty (20)&nbsp;days after receipt of the request. The arbitrator(s) will resolve any discovery disputes. Arbitration proceedings may be commenced by either party by notice to the other party. Unless
otherwise agreed by the parties, all such arbitration proceedings will be held in [London], England, provided that proceedings may be conducted by telephone conference call with the consent of the parties and the arbitrator(s). The arbitrator(s)
will apply the law of New York. The arbitrator(s) will only have the authority to award actual money damages (with interest on unpaid amounts from the date due) and, except with respect to a breach or nonperformance of any provision of this
Agreement relating to Confidential Information, the arbitrator(s) will not have the authority to award indirect, incidental, consequential, exemplary, special or punitive damages, and the parties expressly waive any claimed right to such damages.
The arbitrator(s) also shall be authorized to grant any temporary, preliminary or permanent equitable remedy or relief the arbitrators deem just and equitable and within the scope of this Agreement, including an injunction or order for specific
performance. </P>

The award of the arbitrator(s) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be enforced in any court having competent

in such proceeding. The costs and expenses of the arbitration, but not the costs and expenses of the parties, will be shared equally by the parties. If a party fails to proceed with arbitration, unsuccessfully challenges the arbitration award, or
fails to comply with the arbitration award, the other party is entitled to costs, including reasonable attorneys&#146; fees, for having to compel arbitration or defend or enforce the award. Except as otherwise required by law, the parties and the
