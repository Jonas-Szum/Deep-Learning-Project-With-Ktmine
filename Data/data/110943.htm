<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">1.1 &#147;<U>Acquisition</U>&#148; shall mean the acquisition of a business by Licensee by merger, stock acquisition, asset acquisition or
otherwise. Two or more acquisitions involving the same seller or Affiliate of such seller shall be considered a single Acquisition for purposes of this Agreement if the structure of such acquisitions has no substantial business justification other
than to circumvent the increased Yearly License Fee under Section&nbsp;9.2. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">1.2 &#147;<U>Affiliate</U>&#148; shall mean any subsidiary,
parent company, operating division, or other legal entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control of a Party. If an Affiliate ceases to directly or indirectly control, be controlled by, or be under common
control of a Party, then from and after the date of such cessation, such subsidiary, parent company, operating division, or other legal entity shall cease to be an Affiliate for all purposes under this Agreement. For the purpose of this definition,
&#147;control&#148; means the direct or indirect ownership of more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the legal entity, the right to receive more than 50% of the profits or earnings of the legal entity, or the right to direct the
policy decisions of the legal entity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in any jurisdiction where local law shall not permit foreign equity participation of at least 50%, then &#147;control&#148; shall mean the maximum percentage of such outstanding
stock or rights permitted by such local law. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">1.3 &#147;<U>Assertion</U>&#148; or &#147;<U>Asserted</U>&#148; shall mean an action of any
nature alleging or relating to any claim for monetary or equitable relief, including infringement of any patent right by a product or service, whether through informal communications, written communications, or before any legal, judicial,
arbitration, administrative, executive or other type of body that has or claims to have authority to adjudicate such action in whole or part, such as but not limited to United States state and federal courts, the U.S. International Trade Commission
and any foreign counterparts of the foregoing. </P>

transactions or events), whether by an acquisition of securities, merger, consolidation, proxy contest, sale of all or substantially all of Licensee&#146;s assets, or other transaction or event (or series of transactions or events), that results in
Licensee not being controlled, directly or indirectly, by a party (whether alone or with others) that controlled Licensee before such transaction or event (or series of transactions or events), whether or not Licensee survives such transaction or
event (or series of transactions or events). For the sole purpose of this definition and Article 9, &#147;control&#148; means possession of, or the power or right to acquire possession of, directly or indirectly, the power to direct or cause the
direction of the management of Licensee (whether through ownership of securities, partnership or other ownership interests, by contract or otherwise). For clarity, a restructuring or reorganization of Licensee that does not result in a change in
control of Licensee shall not be deemed to be a Change of Control of Licensee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the initial public offering of Licensee, whether in the United States or outside the United States, shall not constitute a Change of
Control under this Agreement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">1.5 &#147;<U>Covered Acquisition</U>&#148; shall mean an Acquisition where the business of the acquired

(&#147;Recipient&#148;) in connection with this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, &#147;Confidential Information&#148; shall not include information that the Recipient can demonstrate through competent, written evidence: (i)&nbsp;was in its
knowledge or possession prior to disclosure, (ii)&nbsp;was in the public domain at the time of disclosure or subsequently entered the public domain through no fault of Recipient, (iii)&nbsp;was disclosed to Recipient by a third party with the right

the Covered Change of Control (i.e., changes that would result in a product change notice to a customer but not a new product number), and shall not apply to any third party that Controls Licensee or any products, services, features or functionality
developed after the date of the Covered Change of Control. The Licensee or the assignee, as the case may be, may elect, in its sole discretion, to pay or cause to be paid to Finisar a 5% royalty on that portion of the worldwide Revenue attributable
to the sale of products that would be Licensed Products if they were covered by the license granted under this Agreement (in which event such products will be deemed to be Licensed Products and be within, and covered by, the scope of the license).
The Licensee or assignee may make this election by giving written notice to Finisar of its intent to take such a license and be effective as of the date of such notice (the &#147;Notice&#148;). After the Notice has been delivered all such
assignee&#146;s products and new Licensee products shall be deemed to be Licensed Products (the &#147;New Licensed Products&#148;). The 5% royalty on such New Licensed Products would be made in addition to the Yearly License Fee payments due under
Section&nbsp;3.2. For avoidance of doubt, in the event the Licensee or the assignee, as the case may be, does not pay or cause to be paid the royalty described above, the sale of New Licensed Products shall not be considered licensed. </P>
