indemnified unless the Distributor or person, as the case may be, shall have notified the Fund in writing of the claim promptly after the summons or other first written notification giving information of the nature of the claims shall have been
served upon the Distributor or any such person (or after the Distributor or such person shall have received notice of service on any designated agent). However, failure to notify a Fund of any claim shall not relieve that Fund from any liability
which it may have to any person against whom such action is brought otherwise than on account of its indemnity agreement contained in this paragraph. The Fund shall be entitled to participate at its own expense in the defense, or, if it so elects,
to assume the defense of any suit brought to enforce any claims, and if a Fund elects to assume the defense, the defense shall be conducted by counsel chosen by such Fund. In the event a Fund elects to assume the defense of any suit and retain
counsel, the Distributor, officers or directors or controlling person(s) or defendant(s) in the suit, shall bear the fees and expenses of any additional counsel retained by them. If a Fund does not elect to assume the defense of any suit, it will
reimburse the Distributor, officers or directors or controlling person(s) or defendant(s) in the suit for the reasonable fees and expenses of any counsel retained by them. The Fund agrees to notify the Distributor promptly of the commencement of any

that any sales literature, advertisements, information, statements or representations used or made by the Distributor or any of its affiliates or employees or that the registration statement, prospectus, statement of additional information, (as from
time-to-time amended) included an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated or necessary in order to make the statements not misleading, insofar as the statement or omission was made in reliance
upon, and in conformity with, information furnished to such Fund or Managing Owner by or on behalf of the Distributor. In no case (i) is the indemnity of the Distributor in favor of any Indemnified Party to be deemed to protect any such party
against any liability to which the Indemnified Party would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence in the performance of its duties or by reason of its reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under
this Agreement, or (ii) is the Distributor to be liable under its indemnity agreement contained in this paragraph with respect to any claim made against any Indemnified Party unless such Indemnified Party shall have notified the Distributor in
writing of the claim promptly after the summons or other first written notification giving information of the nature of the claim shall have been served upon such Indemnified Party (or after such Indemnified Party shall have received notice of
service on any designated agent). However, failure to notify the Distributor of any claim shall not relieve the Distributor from any liability which it may have to the Indemnified Party against whom the action is brought otherwise than on account of
its indemnity agreement contained in this paragraph. In the case of any notice to the Distributor it shall be entitled to participate, at its own expense, in the defense or, if it so elects, to assume the defense of any suit brought to enforce any
claims, and if the Distributor elects to assume the defense, the defense shall be conducted by counsel chosen by it and satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, to its officers and to any controlling person(s), or defendant(s) in the suit. In the
event that the Distributor elects to assume the defense of any suit and retain counsel, the Indemnified Party or controlling person(s), defendant(s) in the suit, shall bear the fees and expenses of any additional counsel retained by them. If the
Distributor does not elect to assume the defense of any suit, it will reimburse the Indemnified Party, officers or controlling person(s) or defendant(s) in the suit for the reasonable fees and expenses of any counsel retained by them. The
Distributor agrees to notify the Indemnified Party promptly of the commencement of any litigation or proceeding against it in connection with the Indemnified Party and sale of any of the Shares. </P>
