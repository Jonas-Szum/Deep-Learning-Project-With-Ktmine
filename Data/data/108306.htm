<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>WATERTOWN, Mass., November&nbsp;17, 2014</B> &#150; Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: DRNA), a leading developer of RNA interference (RNAi)
therapeutics, today announced a licensing agreement for Dicerna to use Tekmira&#146;s proprietary lipid nanoparticle (LNP) technology for delivery of DCR-PH1, Dicerna&#146;s investigational product candidate for primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1), a
rare, inherited liver disorder that often results in kidney failure, and for which there are no approved therapies. <B> </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">This announcement follows the
successful testing of DCR-PH1 in combination with Tekmira&#146;s LNP technology in animal models, including mice and non-human primates. Under the agreement, Dicerna will pay Tekmira $2.5 million upfront, as well as $22 million in potential
development milestones, and a mid-single-digit royalty on future PH1 sales. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Tekmira&#146;s LNP system has shown in other human clinical studies to
provide potent, safe and effective RNA delivery to hepatocytes (liver cells). Licensing Tekmira&#146;s LNP will streamline the development path for DCR-PH1 and allows Dicerna to focus its LNP efforts on its oncology pipeline. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;Dicerna is focused on realizing the full clinical potential of our proprietary pipeline of highly targeted RNAi therapies by applying proven
technologies,&#148; said Douglas Fambrough, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Dicerna. &#147;By drawing on Tekmira&#146;s extensive and deep experience with lipid nanoparticle delivery to the liver, the agreement will streamline the development path
for DCR-PH1. We look forward to initiating Phase 1 trials of DCR-PH1 in 2015, aiming to fill a high unmet medical need for patients with PH1.&#148;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;This new agreement validates our leadership position in RNAi delivery and underscores the significant value we can bring to partners who leverage our
LNP technology,&#148; said Dr.&nbsp;Mark&nbsp;J. Murray, President and CEO of Tekmira. &#147;Our LNP technology is enabling the most advanced applications of RNAi therapeutics in the clinic. We are excited to be working with Dicerna in advancing a
needed, investigational therapeutic for the treatment of PH1.&#148; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>About RNAi </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">RNAi therapeutics have the potential to treat a number of human diseases by &#147;silencing&#148; disease-causing genes. The discoverers of RNAi, a gene
silencing mechanism used by all cells, were awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. RNAi trigger molecules often require delivery technology to be effective as therapeutics. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Tekmira LNP technology represents the most widely adopted delivery technology for the systemic delivery of RNAi triggers. Tekmira&#146;s LNP platform is being
utilized in multiple clinical trials by Tekmira and its partners. Tekmira&#146;s LNP technology (formerly referred to as stable nucleic acid-lipid particles, or SNALP) encapsulates RNAi triggers with high efficiency in uniform lipid nanoparticles
that are effective in delivering these therapeutic compounds to disease sites. Tekmira&#146;s LNP formulations are manufactured by a proprietary method that is robust, scalable and highly reproducible, and LNP-based products have been reviewed by
multiple regulatory agencies for use in clinical trials. LNP formulations comprise several lipid components that can be adjusted to suit the specific application. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>About </B>Primary Hyperoxaluria Type 1 (<B>PH1)</B> </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">PH1 is a
rare, inherited liver disorder that often results in severe damage to the kidneys. The disease can be fatal unless the patient undergoes a liver-kidney transplant, a major surgical procedure that is often difficult to perform due to the lack of
donors and the threat of organ rejection. In the event of a successful transplant, the patient must live the rest of his or her life on immunosuppressant drugs, which have substantial associated risks. Currently, there are no FDA approved treatments
for PH1. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">PH1 is characterized by a genetic deficiency of the liver enzyme alanine:glyoxalate-aminotransferase (AGT), which is encoded by the AGXT gene.
AGT deficiency induces overproduction of oxalate by the liver, resulting in the formation of crystals of calcium oxalate in the kidneys. Oxalate crystal formation often leads to chronic and painful cases of kidney stones and subsequent fibrosis
(scarring), which is known as nephrocalcinosis. Many patients progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and require dialysis or transplant. Aside from having to endure frequent dialysis, PH1 patients with ESRD may experience a build-up of oxalate
in the bone, skin, heart and retina, with concomitant debilitating complications. While the true prevalence of primary hyperoxaluria is unknown, it is estimated to be one to three cases per one million people.<SUP 
STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">1</SUP> Fifty percent of patients with PH1 reach ESRD by their mid-30s.<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">2</SUP> </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>About DCR-PH1 </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Dicerna is developing DCR-PH1, which is in
preclinical development, for the treatment of PH1. DCR-PH1 is engineered to address the pathology of PH1 by targeting and destroying the messenger RNA (mRNA) produced by HAO1, a gene implicated in the pathogenesis of PH1. HAO1 encodes glycolate
oxidase, a protein involved in producing oxalate. By reducing oxalate production, this approach is designed to prevent the complications of PH1. In preclinical studies, DCR-PH1 has been shown to induce potent and long-term inhibition of HAO1 and to
significantly reduce levels of urinary oxalate, while demonstrating long-term efficacy and tolerability in animal models of PH1. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Dicerna&#146;s proprietary RNAi molecules are known as Dicer substrates, or DsiRNAs, so called because they are processed by the Dicer enzyme, which is the
initiation point for RNAi in the human cell cytoplasm. Dicerna&#146;s discovery approach is believed to maximize RNAi potency because the DsiRNAs are structured to be ideal for processing by Dicer. Dicer processing enables the preferential use of
the correct RNA strand of the DsiRNA, which may increase the efficacy of the RNAi mechanism, as well as the potency of the DsiRNA molecules relative to other molecules used to induce RNAi. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Vancouver, B.C. </B>&#150; Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corporation (NASDAQ:TKMR; TSX:TKM) a leading developer of RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutics, today
announces a licensing and collaboration agreement with Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Tekmira has licensed its proprietary lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery technology for exclusive use in Dicerna&#146;s primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) development
program. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the agreement, Dicerna will pay Tekmira $2.5 million upfront and payments of $22 million in aggregate development milestones, plus a
mid-single-digit royalty on future PH1 sales. This new partnership also includes a supply agreement with Tekmira providing clinical drug supply and regulatory support in the rapid advancement of the product candidate. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The agreement announced today follows the successful testing and demonstration of positive results combining Tekmira&#146;s LNP technology with DCR-PH1 in
pre-clinical animal models. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Dicerna will use Tekmira&#146;s third generation LNP technology for delivery of DCR-PH1, Dicerna&#146;s Dicer substrate RNA
(DsiRNA) molecule, for the treatment of PH1, a rare, inherited liver disorder that often results in kidney failure and for which there are no approved therapies. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;This new agreement validates our leadership position in RNAi delivery with LNP technology, and it underscores the significant value we can bring to
partners who leverage our technology. Our LNP technology is enabling the most advanced applications of RNAi therapeutics in the clinic, and it continues to do so. We are excited to be working with Dicerna to be able to advance a needed therapeutic
for the treatment of PH1,&#148; said Dr.&nbsp;Mark&nbsp;J. Murray, Tekmira&#146;s President and CEO. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;As a core pillar of our business strategy, we
continue to engage in partnerships where our technology improves the risk profile and accelerates the development programs of our collaborators and provides meaningful non-dilutive financing to TKMR,&#148; added Dr.&nbsp;Murray. </P>

RNAi therapies by applying proven technologies,&#148; said Douglas Fambrough, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Dicerna. &#147;By drawing on Tekmira&#146;s extensive and deep experience with lipid nanoparticle delivery to the liver, the agreement
will streamline the development path for DCR-PH1. We look forward to initiating Phase 1 trials of DCR-PH1 in 2015, aiming to fill a high unmet medical need for patients with PH1.&#148;</P>

a number of human diseases by &#147;silencing&#148; disease-causing genes. The discoverers of RNAi, a gene silencing mechanism used by all cells, were awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. RNAi trigger molecules often require
delivery technology to be effective as therapeutics. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>About Tekmira&#146;s LNP Technology </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Tekmira believes its LNP technology represents the most widely adopted delivery technology for the systemic delivery of RNAi triggers. Tekmira&#146;s LNP
platform is being utilized in multiple clinical trials by Tekmira and its partners. Tekmira&#146;s LNP technology (formerly referred to as stable nucleic acid-lipid particles, or SNALP) encapsulates RNAi triggers with high efficiency in uniform
lipid nanoparticles that are effective in delivering these therapeutic compounds to disease sites. Tekmira&#146;s LNP formulations are manufactured by a proprietary method which is robust, scalable and highly reproducible, and LNP-based products
have been reviewed by multiple regulatory agencies for use in clinical trials. LNP formulations comprise several lipid components that can be adjusted to suit the specific application. </P>

rare, inherited liver disorder that often results in severe damage to the kidneys. The disease can be fatal unless the patient undergoes a liver-kidney transplant, a major surgical procedure that is often difficult to perform due to the lack of
donors and the threat of organ rejection. In the event of a successful transplant, the patient must live the rest of his or her life on immunosuppressant drugs, which have substantial associated risks. Currently, there are no FDA approved treatments
for PH1. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">PH1 is characterized by a genetic deficiency of the liver enzyme alanine:glyoxalate-aminotransferase (AGT), which is encoded by the AGXT gene.
AGT deficiency induces overproduction of oxalate by the liver, resulting in the formation of crystals of calcium oxalate in the kidneys. Oxalate crystal formation often leads to chronic and painful cases of kidney stones and subsequent fibrosis
(scarring), which is known as </P>

nephrocalcinosis. Many patients progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and require dialysis or transplant. Aside from having to endure frequent dialysis, PH1 patients with ESRD may experience
a build-up of oxalate in the bone, skin, heart and retina, with concomitant debilitating complications. While the true prevalence of primary hyperoxaluria is unknown, it is estimated to be one to three cases per one million people.<SUP

preclinical development, for the treatment of PH1. DCR-PH1 is engineered to address the pathology of PH1 by targeting and destroying the messenger RNA (mRNA) produced by HAO1, a gene implicated in the pathogenesis of PH1. HAO1 encodes glycolate
oxidase, a protein involved in producing oxalate. By reducing oxalate production, this approach is designed to prevent the complications of PH1. In preclinical studies, DCR-PH1 has been shown to induce potent and long-term inhibition of HAO1 and to
significantly reduce levels of urinary oxalate, while demonstrating long-term efficacy and tolerability in animal models of PH1. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>About Dicerna&#146;s
Dicer Substrate Technology </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Dicerna&#146;s proprietary RNAi molecules are known as Dicer substrates, or DsiRNAs, so called because they are processed
by the Dicer enzyme, which is the initiation point for RNAi in the human cell cytoplasm. Dicerna&#146;s discovery approach is believed to maximize RNAi potency because the DsiRNAs are structured to be ideal for processing by Dicer. Dicer processing
enables the preferential use of the correct RNA strand of the DsiRNA, which may increase the efficacy of the RNAi mechanism, as well as the potency of the DsiRNA molecules relative to other molecules used to induce RNAi. </P>
