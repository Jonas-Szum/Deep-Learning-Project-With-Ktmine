below, Harvard will be responsible for the Prosecution and Maintenance of all Harvard Patent Rights, using independent patent counsel reasonably acceptable to Licensee. Licensee shall have the right, at any time and from time to time during the term
of this Agreement upon a showing by Licensee of material cause as to why such independent patent counsel no longer is reasonably acceptable to Licensee, to request that such independent patent counsel be replaced, in which case Harvard shall replace
such independent patent counsel with another independent patent counsel selected by Harvard and reasonably acceptable to Licensee. Licensee shall have full rights of consultation with such independent patent counsel on all matters relating to the
Harvard Patent Rights. Harvard will: (a)&nbsp;instruct such patent counsel to furnish Licensee with copies of all correspondence relating to the Harvard Patent Rights from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and any other patent
office, as well as copies of all proposed responses to such correspondence in time for Licensee to review and comment on such response; (b)&nbsp;give Licensee an opportunity to review the text of each patent application before filing;
(c)&nbsp;consult with Licensee with respect thereto; (d)&nbsp;supply Licensee with a copy of the application as filed, together with notice of its filing date and serial number; and (e)&nbsp;keep Licensee advised of the status of actual and

requests in good faith and shall incorporate, or cause to be incorporated, such comments and requests unless Harvard reasonably and in good faith believes that such comments and requests will not result in an outcome that best addresses the
interests of both Harvard and Licensee as licensor and licensee (e.g., will result in less patent protection than would be available if such comments and requests were not incorporated). For so long as Licensee is complying with its obligations
under Section&nbsp;6.3, Harvard must Prosecute and Maintain and protect the Harvard Patent Rights in those countries as Licensee shall request from time to time and Harvard shall have no right to abandon any such Patent Rights. If Licensee fails at
any time to comply with its obligations to pay for Prosecution or Maintenance or protection of the Harvard Patent Rights under Section&nbsp;6.3, then Harvard will provide all Sublicensee(s) of such Harvard Patent Rights with written notice of such
breach within sufficient time for such Sublicensees to pay such required amounts without any loss or abandonment of rights under the affected Harvard Patent Rights. Such Sublicensee(s) will thereafter have the right, but not the obligation, to pay
such amounts and, if such Sublicensee(s) make such payment, Harvard shall continue to Prosecute and Maintain and protect the affected Harvard Patent Rights for as long as it continues to be paid the amounts due under Section&nbsp;6.3 by Licensee or
