Seller shall provide Purchaser with a due diligence period of thirty (30) days from the Execution Date of this Agreement (&#8220;Due
Diligence Period&#8221;). During this Due Diligence Period and thereafter until the Closing Date, Seller shall fully cooperate
with Purchaser in the Purchaser continuing its due diligence as to the Business, the Assets and the Real Estate being acquired
pursuant to the REPA. The Due Diligence Period will be extended if the documents requested pursuant to the due diligence request
(&#8220;Diligence Request&#8221;) which will be provided within five (5) days of this Agreement to a period of thirty (30) days
from the date of the production of the last item requested pursuant to the Diligence Request. By way of example, Seller shall
provide to Purchaser copies of the Property Materials in Seller&#8217;s possession or control, as well as any liens, liabilities
or encumbrances pertaining to the Assets. For purposes hereof, &quot;<U>Property Materials</U>&quot; shall mean any prior title
insurance policy, surveys, any Phase I reports, Phase II reports, inspection reports, zoning reports and all other written materials
pertaining to the properties being acquired under the REPA. Purchaser and its representatives, agents and licensed contractors
may make such tests, surveys and inspections of the Assets and properties as Purchaser deems necessary for its due diligence,
including without limitation, Phase II reports, environmental assessments and testing, soil tests, environmental audits, structural
and foundation surveys, equipment inspections and testing and topographical surveys (&quot;<U>Environmental Investigation</U>&quot;),
from time to time, at the sole cost and expense of Purchaser. Purchaser shall have no responsibility under this Agreement with
respect to the discovery of any hazardous or toxic waste, substance or material, pollutant or contaminant, including asbestos,
as defined for purposes of Environmental Law (&quot;<U>Hazardous Substance</U>&quot;) or any other condition found or discovered
on or relating to the Purchased Assets or to undertake any remedial action on or relating to the Purchased Assets as a result
of the inspections or tests undertaken by Purchaser and its representatives, agents or licensed contractors unless and to the
extent that the presence of Hazardous Substances is due solely and directly to the acts of Purchaser and/or its representatives,
agents or licensed contractors. For purposes of any Environmental Investigation, Purchaser agrees to (i) carry and to cause its
representatives, agents and licensed contractors to carry commercially reasonable insurance coverages adequate to cover the Environmental
Investigation activities; (ii) except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, defend, indemnify and save Seller harmless from
and against all claims, out-of-pocket costs, expenses, losses and other obligations (including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys' fees and court costs) incurred, directly on account of any loss, damage or</P>

<P STYLE="margin: 0; text-align: justify">injury to any person or property, by reason
of any negligent act or omission of Purchaser, its representatives, agents or licensed contractors, in connection with any Environmental
Investigation; and (iii) restore the properties at Purchaser's sole cost to the condition that existed immediately prior to the
commencement of the Environmental Investigation. In the event that Purchaser notifies Seller of any environmental objection or
in the event that Purchaser's due diligence reveals any other violation of Environmental Law or presence of Hazardous Substances
on, in or under any of the properties, Purchaser shall immediately notify Seller thereof and Seller, and not Purchaser or anyone
acting on Purchaser's behalf, shall make any disclosures to any Governmental Body as Seller deems appropriate. Upon Purchaser
providing Seller with notice reasonably in advance, Seller shall permit Purchaser to have necessary access to conduct due diligence
regarding Seller's medical billing and coding practices, including access to all supporting documents as Purchaser shall reasonably
request. Access related to medical billing and coding practices shall be completed within thirty (30) days following Seller's
provision of the requested materials. If Purchaser undertakes an on-site review of such materials at premises of Seller, then
such access shall be provided only during normal business hours, and Purchaser shall conduct such review in a manner so as not
to interfere with the normal business operations of Seller.</P>

an amount of up to but not to exceed fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) of claims by insurance companies for recoupment of any
overpayments that may have been made for services rendered by Seller which arose prior to the Closing Date or period in which
the parties operated under the MSA for which payment was received by Seller prior to the commencement of the term of the MSA.
Buyer shall be responsible for all overpayments in which the revenue was received by Buyer after the commencement of the term
of the MSA regardless of the amount. The assumption by Purchaser on the Closing Date of any liabilities hereunder is made for
the exclusive benefit of the Seller and not for the benefit of any third party and such assumption, while creating a liability
of Purchaser to the Seller hereunder, shall not be deemed to create any liability of Purchaser to any third party other than to
the payee of the Assumed Liabilities. Purchaser agrees to use its best efforts following the Closing Date to cause the Seller
to be relieved from their obligations under the Assumed Liabilities, provided, however, that Purchaser shall not be required by
