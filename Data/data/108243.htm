Infringement</B>. If any Third Party Claim for which indemnity is or may be sought by SpePharm Indemnitees pursuant to Section
13.2(c), is made or appears reasonably possible, SpePharm agrees (i) promptly to notify Company in writing; (ii) to cooperate with
Company, and to allow Company sole authority to control the defense and settlement of such Third Party Claim at Company&rsquo;s
cost and expense (subject to Section 11.5); and (iii) to permit Company to take such actions necessary, as the Party&rsquo;s reasonably
agree and in good faith and at the Party&rsquo;s equally shared cost and expense, to enable SpePharm to continue to use the allegedly
infringing aspect of the Product or to obtain licenses (subject to Section 11.5) for, modify or replace any such infringing material
to make it non-infringing (provided that such modifications or replacements do not require SpePharm to obtain approval from a Regulatory
Authority in order to manufacture, sell or Commercialize the Product containing such modifications or replacements). In the event
the Company desires to obtain any license for any Third Party intellectual property right for the Product in the Field and Territory,
it shall first offer SpePharm the right to obtain such license (in which case the terms of Section 10.4(d) shall apply) or Company
may take such license with prior notice to SpePharm (in which the terms of Section 11.5 shall apply). In no event shall Company
be obligated to indemnify SpePharm for Third Party Claims for which indemnity is or may be sought by SpePharm Indemnitees pursuant
to Section 13.2(c) in amounts in excess of fifty percent (50%) all amounts paid by SpePharm to Company hereunder as of the date
of such Third Party Claim. If Company ceases to indemnify the SpePharm Indemnitees for such Third Party Claim, then SpePharm shall
have the right, upon written notice to Company, to assume sole authority to control the defense and settlement of such Third Party
Claim. Notwithstanding, if a Third Party Claim has been filed against a SpePharm Indemnitee in a court of competent jurisdiction
for which indemnity is or may be sought by such SpePharm Indemnitee pursuant to Section 13.2(c), and Company determines that none
of the foregoing alternatives is reasonably available and provides written notice of the same to SpePharm, SpePharm, its Affiliates
and Sublicensees will have the option to, in SpePharm&rsquo;s sole discretion, either (a) cease sale, distribution and use of,
and, if applicable, return, such materials as are the subject of the relevant infringement claim, or (b) continue the sale, distribution
and use of such materials, in which case Company&rsquo;s obligation to indemnify the SpePharm Indemnitees pursuant to Section 13.2(c)
in respect of such infringement claim shall be limited solely to liability resulting from sales, distributions and uses of such
materials occurring prior to receipt of such notice from Company.</P>

and Limitations of Indemnification Obligation.</B> Each Party shall notify the other in the event it becomes aware of a claim for
which indemnification may be sought hereunder pursuant to this Section 13. In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation)
shall be instituted involving any Party in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to this Section 13, such Party (the
&ldquo;<B>Indemnified Party</B>&rdquo;) shall provide the other Party (the &ldquo;<B>Indemnifying Party</B>&rdquo;) with prompt
written notice of such proceeding (the &ldquo;<B>Indemnification Claim Notice</B>&rdquo;). Promptly after the Indemnifying Party
receives the Indemnification Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party shall meet to discuss how to respond to
any claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding. At its option, the Indemnifying Party may assume the defense of any
Third Party claim subject to indemnification as provided for in this Section 13 by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party
within thirty (30) days (or within such time provided in any applicable extension to appropriately answer any complaint, if any,
but no longer than seventy (70) days, provided that the Indemnified Party makes all reasonable efforts to obtain any such extension)
after the Indemnifying Party&rsquo;s receipt of an Indemnification Claim Notice, provided that (a) the claim solely seeks monetary
damages and (b) the Indemnifying Party expressly agrees in writing that, as between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be solely obligated to satisfy and discharge the claim in full (the matters described in (a)
and (b), the &ldquo;<B>Litigation Conditions</B>&rdquo;). The Indemnified Party may, at any time, assume all such defense if the
Litigation Conditions are not satisfied. Upon assuming the defense of a Third Party claim in accordance with this Section 13, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to appoint lead counsel in the defense of the Third Party claim. Should the Indemnifying Party
assume and continue the defense of a Third Party Claim, except as otherwise set forth in this Section 13, the Indemnifying Party
shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection
with the analysis, defense or settlement of the Third Party claim. Without limiting this Section 13, any Indemnified Party shall
be entitled to participate in, but not control, the defense of a Third Party Claim for which it has sought indemnification hereunder
and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose; provided, however, that such employment shall be at the Indemnified Party&rsquo;s
own expense unless (i) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the Indemnifying Party in writing; (ii) the Indemnifying
Party has failed to assume and actively further the defense and employ counsel in accordance with this Section 13.4 (in which case
the Indemnified Party shall control the defense); or (iii) the Indemnifying Party no longer satisfies the Litigation Conditions.
With respect to any Losses relating solely to the payment of money damages in connection with a Third Party Claim that shall not
result in the Indemnified Party&rsquo;s becoming subject to injunctive or other relief or otherwise adversely affect the business
of the Indemnified Party in any manner, and as to which the Indemnifying Party shall have acknowledged in writing the obligation
to indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder, and subject to the Litigation Conditions being satisfied, the Indemnifying Party
shall have the sole right to consent to the entry of any judgment, enter into any settlement or otherwise dispose of such Losses,
on such terms as the Indemnifying Party, in its reasonable discretion, shall deem appropriate (provided that such terms shall include
a complete and unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all liability with respect thereto), and shall transfer to the
Indemnified Party all amounts which said Indemnified Party shall be liable to pay prior to the time of the entry of judgment. With
respect to all other Losses in connection with Third Party Claims, where the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of the
Third Party claim in accordance with this Article 13, the Indemnifying Party shall have authority to consent to the entry of any
judgment, enter into any settlement or otherwise dispose of such Liability, provided that it obtains the prior written consent
of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall be at the Indemnified Party&rsquo;s reasonable discretion). The Indemnifying Party
that has assumed the defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance with this Article 13 shall not be liable for any settlement
or other disposition of a Loss by an Indemnified Party (but in no event to include any court judgment or judicial or administrative
order or disposition) that is reached without the written consent of such Indemnifying Party. No Indemnified Party shall admit
any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, any Third Party Claim without first offering to the Indemnifying
Party the opportunity to assume the defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance with this Article 13. If the Indemnifying Party
chooses to defend or prosecute any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof
and shall furnish such records, information and testimony, provide such witnesses and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings,
hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested in connection with such Third Party Claim. Such cooperation shall include
access during normal business hours afforded to the Indemnifying Party to, and reasonable retention by the Indemnified Party of,
records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees and agents available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder, and the Indemnifying
Party shall reimburse the Indemnified Party for all its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with such cooperation.</P>

confidential treatment should be sought; provided that no further review shall be provided for disclosures for which consent has
been obtained. Notwithstanding, with respect to the filing of this Agreement by Company with the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission, Company shall provide SpePharm with at least five (5) business days to review and comment on such proposed filing.</P>

In consideration of the rights granted hereunder, Norgine hereby guarantees in favor of Company the full payment and performance
by SpePharm of all obligations of SpePharm under this Agreement, in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
including any applicable notice or cure periods. This guaranty shall be enforceable upon the failure by SpePharm to perform any
obligation it may have under this Agreement in accordance with its terms, and shall be effective regardless of the solvency or
insolvency of SpePharm at any time, the extension or modification of the obligations of this Agreement by operation of law, or
the subsequent reorganization, merger, consolidation or other restructuring of SpePharm. Norgine hereby expressly waives any requirement
that Company exhaust any right, power or remedy under this Agreement, or proceed against any other SpePharm entity under this Agreement,
for any obligation or performance hereunder prior to proceeding directly against Norgine under this Section 17.9. In the event
that this Agreement is transferred or assigned by SpePharm to a Third Party which is not an Affiliate of Norgine, or if a Business
Combination occurs with respect to SpePharm and a Third Party which is not an Affiliate of Norgine, then Norgine&rsquo;s obligations
under this Section 17.9 shall terminate, and the successor to SpePharm&rsquo;s rights in this Agreement or the successor to SpePharm,
as the case maybe, shall assume such obligations under this Section 17.9.</P>

and distribution of Lymphoseek<SUP>&reg; </SUP>250 microgram kit for radiopharmaceutical preparation (tilmanocept) in the European

a receptor-targeted, radiopharmaceutical imaging agent approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2013 and by the EU
in November 2014. Lymphoseek is approved in Europe for imaging and intraoperative detection of sentinel lymph nodes in patients
with breast cancer, melanoma, or localized squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity. In these <FONT STYLE="background-color: white">procedures,
key lymph nodes adjacent to a primary tumor, that may contain tumor metastases, are identified and biopsied to determine if cancer

Rick Gonzalez, President and Chief Executive Officer of Navidea. &ldquo;We anticipate a successful and mutually-beneficial partnership

to market access development was especially important to us since, unlike the United States where institutions typically rely on
unit dose distribution of radiopharmaceutical products by specialized radio-pharmacy distributors, institutions in Europe purchase
non-radiolabeled material and compound the finished product on-site,&rdquo; added Mr. Gonzalez &ldquo;As a specialist pharmaceutical
company, Norgine is optimally positioned to interface directly with a targeted surgical oncologist customer base with a dedicated
sales force. We expect Norgine to begin market access work immediately in the major markets in Europe with the goal of supporting
commercial launch sometime in early 2016.&rdquo;</P>

(technetium Tc 99m tilmanocept) injection is the first and only FDA-approved receptor-targeted lymphatic mapping agent. It is a
novel, receptor-targeted, small-molecule radiopharmaceutical used in the evaluation of lymphatic basins that may have cancer involvement
in patients. Lymphoseek is designed for the precise identification of lymph nodes that drain from a primary tumor, which have the
highest probability of harboring cancer. Lymphoseek is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in solid
tumor cancers where lymphatic mapping is a component of surgical management and for guiding sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients
with clinically node negative breast cancer, melanoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity. Lymphoseek has also received
European approval in imaging and intraoperative detection of sentinel lymph nodes in patients with melanoma, breast cancer or localized
squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity.</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; background-color: white">Accurate diagnostic
evaluation of cancer is critical, as it guides therapy decisions and determines patient prognosis and risk of recurrence. Overall
in the U.S., solid tumor cancers may represent up to 1.2 million cases per year. The sentinel node label in the U.S. and Europe
may address approximately 235,000 new cases of breast cancer, 76,000 new cases of melanoma and 45,000 new cases of head and neck/oral
cancer in the U.S., and approximately 367,000 new cases of breast cancer, 83,000 new cases of melanoma and 55,000 new cases of
