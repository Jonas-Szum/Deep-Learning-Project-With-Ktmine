<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(a) <U>Informal Resolution</U>. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, in the event of any dispute, claim, or controversy arising
under, out of, or in connection with this Agreement (a &#147;<U>Dispute</U>&#148;), including as to the breach, performance, or interpretation of this Agreement or the rights, duties or liabilities of either Party hereunder, the Parties will first
attempt in good faith to resolve such Dispute by negotiation and consultation between themselves. If such Dispute is not resolved on an informal basis within thirty&nbsp;(30) days, each Party may, at its sole discretion, seek resolution of such
matter in accordance with Section&nbsp;16.9 and exercise its rights according to any other applicable sections of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, <U>Section&nbsp;14</U>. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(b) <U>Arbitration</U>. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section, if the Parties do not reach a mutually acceptable resolution
pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;16.9(a)</U> as to a Dispute, the Dispute shall be referred for resolution by final, binding arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this Section. The arbitration shall be conducted by the American Arbitration
Association (or any successor entity thereto) (&#147;<U>AAA</U>&#148;) under its rules of commercial arbitration then in effect, except as modified in this Agreement. The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language, by a single arbitrator
knowledgeable in the subject matter at issue in the Dispute and acceptable to both Parties; provided, however, that the Parties may by mutual agreement elect to have the arbitration conducted by a panel of three arbitrators (such single arbitrator
or panel, the &#147;<U>Arbitrator</U>&#148;). The Arbitrator shall, if appropriate, engage an independent expert with experience in the subject matter of the Dispute to advise the Arbitrator. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(i) With respect to any Dispute referred to arbitration pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;16.9</U>, the Parties and the
Arbitrator shall use all reasonable efforts to complete any such arbitration within three (3)&nbsp;months from the issuance of notice of a referral of any such Dispute to arbitration. The Arbitrator shall determine what discovery will be permitted,
consistent with the goal of limiting the cost and time which the Parties must expend for discovery; provided that the Arbitrator shall permit such discovery as he or she deems necessary to permit an equitable resolution of the Dispute. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(ii) The decision of the Arbitrator shall be the sole, exclusive, and binding remedy between them regarding the Dispute
presented to the Arbitrator. Any decision of the Arbitrator may be entered in a court of competent jurisdiction for judicial recognition of the decision and an order of enforcement. The arbitration proceedings and the decision of the Arbitrator
shall not be made public without the joint consent of the Parties, and each Party shall maintain the confidentiality of such proceedings and decision. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(iii) Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, the arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in Los Angeles, California. The
Parties shall share equally the cost of the arbitration filing and hearing fees, the cost of the independent expert retained by the Arbitrator, and the cost of the Arbitrator and administrative fees of AAA. Each Party shall bear its own costs and
attorneys&#146; and witnesses&#146; fees and associated costs and expenses. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(c) <U>Temporary Relief</U>. Pending the selection of the
Arbitrator or pending the Arbitrator&#146;s determination of the merits of any Dispute, either Party may seek appropriate interim or provisional relief from any court of competent jurisdiction as necessary to protect the rights or property of that
Party. </P>
