this Agreement; <U>except</U>, <U>however</U>, that with respect to any dispute that may arise
under this Agreement in connection with a Party&#146;s intellectual property rights, such dispute shall
to the extent it may be otherwise governed by the laws of the various states, shall in such a case
be governed by the laws of the State of Georgia, disregarding such states&#146; conflict of law
provisions. The Parties disclaim application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the

<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%"><B>8.4 Alternative Dispute Resolution. </B>The Parties will attempt to settle any claim arising out
of this Agreement through good-faith negotiation. The following process will be used to resolve
disputes. The Parties will submit the dispute in writing to a senior executive from each Party. If
those attempts fail, any Party may demand non-binding mediation, the cost of which will be shared
equally by the Parties, except that each Party will pay its own attorney&#146;s fees. Within thirty
(30)&nbsp;days after written notice demanding mediation, the Parties will in good faith choose a
mutually acceptable mediator. If the dispute cannot be resolved through mediation within ninety
days, any Party may submit the dispute to a court of competent jurisdiction. Use of any dispute
resolution procedure will not be construed under the doctrines of laches, waiver, or estoppel to
adversely affect the rights of either Party. Either Party may resort to judicial proceedings for
intellectual property disputes or if interim relief is necessary to prevent serious and irreparable
injury.
 
 
<P align="left" style="font-size: 11pt; text-indent: 4%"><B>8.5 Venue and Jurisdiction. </B>This Agreement shall be governed as to validity, interpretation,

suit, action, proceeding or judgment relating to or arising out of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby. Each Party irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of any such
court in any such suit, action or proceeding and to the laying of venue in such court, irrevocably
waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such
courts, and irrevocably waives any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any
such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

cause irreparable harm and significant injury to the other party that may be difficult to ascertain
and that a remedy at law would be inadequate. Accordingly, each party shall have the right to seek
and obtain injunctive relief to enforce obligations under the Agreement in addition to any other
rights and remedies it may have, with the defending Party in such case waiving the right it may
otherwise have to requiring the posting of a bond; provided, however, each party, shall have the
right to immediately seek and obtain injunctive relief without any written notice to the other
party or if such breach is of a nature that is not subject to cure or is otherwise based on any
violation of applicable law or a breach of any covenant pursuant to which a Party agrees to refrain
