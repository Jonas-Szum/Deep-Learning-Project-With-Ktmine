such equity holders in any subsequent transactions including, without limitation, any Program Sale Transactions and any KemPharm Sale Transactions. KemPharm or the Affiliate who is a party to the KemPharm Sale Transaction shall provide to MSRx

its own valuation expert. The two independent valuation experts shall prepare a written determination of such Value within three (3)&nbsp;months of selection. If the determination of the two valuation experts vary by [*] or less, the Parties shall

valuation experts shall select a third independent valuation expert to prepare its own valuation of the Value attributed to such KemPharm Sale Transaction. The third valuation expert will, at a minimum, evaluate the valuations of the first two
valuation experts and conduct its own analyses as necessary to support its own valuation. The three independent valuation experts shall agree to comply with this schedule of performance before accepting appointment. The Parties shall accept as final
and binding the average of the determinations by the three independent valuation experts as the Value attributed in such KemPharm Sale Transaction. The Parties agree that each independent valuation expert engaged for the purposes of determining
Value pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;4.2</U> shall be at least a partner or director of a nationally recognized appraisal firm, which may be an investment banking firm, a certified public accounting firm, or any other firm that performs appraisal
and valuation services in the pharmaceutical industry. The Parties agree that any and all costs associated with the first (and, if applicable, the third) valuation expert and its valuation determination shall be paid equally by MSRx and KemPharm.
The Parties also agree that the Value shall be equal to a percentage of the KemPharm Sale Price, which percentage shall be proportionate to the value of KemPharm&#146;s and/or its Affiliate&#146;s rights, title or interests in KP415 expressed as a
