Confidential Information may include unique combinations of separate items, which individually may or may not be confidential. To constitute Confidential Information of a Party, the Party must designate or otherwise indicate that the Confidential Information is confidential at the time of disclosure, and if such disclosure was made in writing or in other tangible form, it was marked &#8220;confidential&#8221;, and if made orally, it was or will be reduced to writing or in other tangible form and marked &#8220;confidential&#8221; within thirty (30) days of the oral disclosure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information does not include information (i) already known by the Receiving Party without an obligation of confidentiality; (ii) publicly known or which becomes publicly known through no omission or unauthorized act of the Receiving Party; (iii) rightfully received from a third party without any obligation of confidentiality; or (iv) independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of the Disclosing Party&#8217;s Confidential Information.</p>

The Receiving Party shall disclose Confidential Information only (i) to those of its employees, contractors, representatives and consultants with a need to know such Confidential Information who have first agreed with the Receiving Party, either as a condition of employment or engagement, or in order to obtain the Confidential Information, to be bound by terms and conditions substantially similar to those contained in this Section 5, (ii) as required by court order, law or regulation or as requested by any regulatory agency or governmental body having jurisdiction over the Receiving Party, provided that prior to such disclosure the Receiving Party shall provide prompt written notice to the Disclosing Party sufficient to permit the Disclosing Party the opportunity to oppose the disclosure and the Receiving Party shall take all reasonable steps available to maintain the Confidential Information in confidence, or (iii) to make appropriate disclosure regarding the tax treatment and tax structure of the transactions contemplated hereby.</p>
