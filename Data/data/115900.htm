the pharmaceutical and life sciences industries (or by JAMS in accordance with its rules if the Parties are unable to reach agreement). Each Party will have all rights of discovery as provided by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for any arbitral
proceeding pursuant to this Section&nbsp;12.2.2. Either Party may apply to the arbitrator for interim injunctive relief or may seek from any court having jurisdiction any injunctive or provisional relief necessary to protect the rights or property
of that Party pending resolution of the matter pursuant to this Section&nbsp;12.2. The Parties will have the right to be represented by counsel. Any judgment or award rendered by the arbitrator will be final and binding on the Parties, and will be
governed by the terms and conditions hereof, including the limitation on damages set forth in Section&nbsp;10.5. The Parties agree that such a judgment or award may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The Parties agree that all
applicable statutes of limitation and time-based defenses (such as estoppel and laches) will be tolled while the dispute resolution procedures set forth in this Section&nbsp;12.2 are pending. The non-prevailing Party will bear its and the prevailing
Party&#146;s costs and expenses and attorneys&#146; fees in the arbitration, except that the arbitrator may order instead each Party to bear its own costs and expenses and attorneys&#146; fees in the arbitration if the arbitrator finds that the
non-prevailing Party&#146;s positions on the issues in the dispute had relative merit. The Party that does not prevail in the arbitration proceeding in all instances will pay the arbitrator&#146;s fees and expenses and any administrative fees of
arbitration. All proceedings and decisions of the arbitrator(s) will be deemed Confidential Information of each of the Parties, and will be subject to Article VIII. </P>
