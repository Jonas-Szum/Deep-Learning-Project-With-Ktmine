Allowance may be used solely for the design and construction of fixed and permanent improvements in the Premises desired by and performed by Tenant (the &#147;<B>Tenant Improvements</B>&#148;). Tenant acknowledges that upon the expiration of the
Term of the Lease, the Tenant Improvements shall become the property of Landlord and may not be removed by Tenant. Except for the TI Allowance, Tenant shall be solely responsible for all of the costs of the Tenant Improvements. The Tenant
Improvements shall be treated as Alterations and shall be undertaken pursuant to and in accordance with <U>Section&nbsp;10</U> of this Lease and shall be subject to Landlord&#146;s prior written consent, which may be given or withheld in
Landlord&#146;s sole discretion if any such Alteration affects the Building structure or Building Systems (as defined in <U>Section&nbsp;11</U>) and shall not be otherwise unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Landlord and Tenant agree that
the plans attached to this Lease as <B>Exhibit F</B> (the &#147;<B>TI Plans</B>&#148;) have been approved by Landlord and Tenant and, to the extent that the Tenant Improvements performed by Tenant are substantially consistent with such plans, no
further consent or approval from Landlord shall be required with respect thereto. The contractor for the Tenant Improvements shall be selected by Tenant, subject to Landlord&#146;s approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Landlord hereby approves of The Richmond Group as the general contractor of the Tenant Improvements. Prior to the commencement of the Tenant Improvements, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord a copy of any contract with Tenant&#146;s
contractors (including the architect), and certificates of insurance from any contractor performing any part of the Tenant Improvements evidencing industry standard commercial general liability, automotive liability, &#147;builder&#146;s risk&#148;,

general contractor&#146;s liability coverages required above. During the course of design and construction of the Tenant Improvements, Landlord shall reimburse Tenant for the cost of the Tenant Improvements once a month against a draw request in
Landlord&#146;s standard form, containing evidence of payment of the applicable costs and such certifications, lien waivers (including a conditional lien release for each progress payment and unconditional lien releases for the prior month&#146;s
progress payments), inspection reports and other matters as Landlord customarily obtains, to the extent of Landlord&#146;s approval thereof for payment, no later than 30 days following receipt of such draw request. Upon completion of the Tenant
Improvements (and prior to any final disbursement of the TI Allowance) Tenant shall deliver to Landlord the following items: (i)&nbsp;sworn statements setting forth the names of all contractors and subcontractors who did work on the Tenant
Improvements and final lien waivers from all such contractors and subcontractors; and (ii)&nbsp;&#147;as built&#148; plans or marked-up construction drawings for the Tenant Improvements. Landlord shall be entitled to receive the benefit of all
construction warranties and manufacturer&#146;s equipment warranties relating to equipment installed in the Premises as part of the Tenant Improvements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the cost of the Tenant Improvements exceeds the TI Allowance,
Tenant shall be required to pay such excess prior to the distribution of the then-remaining unpaid TI Allowance. The TI Allowance shall only be available for use by Tenant for the construction of the Tenant Improvements in the Premises until the
date that is 12 months after the Commencement Date, and any portion of the TI Allowance which has not been requested for reimbursement by Tenant pursuant to the terms of this paragraph on or before the date that is 12 months after the Commencement

Tenant hereunder, make such payment or perform such act that is the subject of the Default. All sums so paid or incurred by Landlord, together with interest thereon, from the date such sums were paid or incurred, at the annual rate equal to
12%&nbsp;per annum or the highest rate permitted by law (the &#147;<B>Default Rate</B>&#148;), whichever is less, shall be payable to Landlord on demand as Additional Rent. Nothing herein shall be construed to create or impose a duty on Landlord to
mitigate any damages resulting from Tenant&#146;s Default hereunder. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(b) <B>Late Payment Rent</B>. Late payment by Tenant to Landlord of
Rent and other sums due will cause Landlord to incur costs not contemplated by this Lease, the exact amount of which will be extremely difficult and impracticable to ascertain. Such costs include, but are not limited to, processing and accounting
charges and late charges which may be imposed on Landlord under any Mortgage covering the Premises. Therefore, if any installment of Rent due from Tenant is not received by Landlord within 5 days after the date such payment is due, Tenant shall pay
to Landlord an additional sum of 6% of the overdue Rent as a late charge. Notwithstanding the foregoing, before assessing a late charge the first time in any calendar year, Landlord shall provide Tenant written notice of the delinquency and will

shall have in addition to all other rights and remedies provided in this Lease, at law or in equity, the option to pursue any one or more of the following remedies, each and all of which shall be cumulative and nonexclusive, without any notice or

reasonable judgment, the proposed assignee or subtenant lacks the creditworthiness to support the financial obligations it will incur under the proposed assignment or sublease; (5)&nbsp;in Landlord&#146;s reasonable judgment, the character,
reputation, or business of the proposed assignee or subtenant is inconsistent with the desired tenant-mix or the quality of other tenancies in the Project or is inconsistent with the type and quality of the nature of the Building; (6)&nbsp;Landlord
has received from any prior landlord to the proposed assignee or subtenant a negative report concerning such prior landlord&#146;s experience with the proposed assignee or subtenant; (7)&nbsp;Landlord has experienced previous defaults by or is in

</TABLE> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The PACMs described above were observed to be in good condition and may be managed in place. Because ACMs may be present
within or about the Building, we have hired an independent environmental consulting firm to prepare an operations and maintenance program (&#147;<B>O&amp;M Program</B>&#148;). The O&amp;M Program is designed to minimize the potential of any harmful
asbestos exposure to any person within or about the Building. The O&amp;M Program includes a description of work methods to be taken in order to maintain any ACMs or PACMs within or about the Building in good condition and to prevent any significant
disturbance of such ACMs or PACMs. Appropriate personnel receive regular periodic training on how to properly administer the O&amp;M Program. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The O&amp;M
Program describes the risks associated with asbestos exposure and how to prevent such exposure through appropriate work practices. ACMs and PACMs generally are not thought to be a threat to human health unless asbestos fibers are released into the
air and inhaled. This does not typically occur unless (1)&nbsp;the ACMs are in a deteriorating condition, or (2)&nbsp;the ACMs have been significantly disturbed (such as through abrasive cleaning, or maintenance or renovation activities). If
inhaled, asbestos fibers can accumulate in the lungs and, as exposure increases, the risk of disease (such as asbestosis or cancer) increases. However, measures to minimize exposure, and consequently minimize the accumulation of asbestos fibers,
reduce the risks of adverse health effects. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The O&amp;M Program describes a number of activities that should be avoided in order to prevent a release of
asbestos fibers. In particular, you should be aware that some of the activities which may present a health risk include moving, drilling, boring, or otherwise disturbing ACMs. Consequently, such activities should not be attempted by any person not
qualified to handle ACMs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The O&amp;M Program is available for review during regular business hours at Landlord&#146;s office located at 400 Technology
