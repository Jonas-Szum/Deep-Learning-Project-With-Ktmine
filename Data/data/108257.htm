Duties of the Parties.</B> JHU is not a commercial organization. It is an institute of research and education. Therefore, JHU has no ability to evaluate the commercial potential of any Licensed Patent Rights or Licensed Product or other license or
rights granted in this Agreement. It is therefore incumbent upon Company to evaluate the rights and products in question, to examine the materials and information provided by JHU, and to determine for itself the validity of any Licensed Patent
Rights, its freedom to operate, and the value of any Licensed Products or Licensed Services or other rights granted. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>6.2
Representations by JHU.</B> JHU warrants that it has good and marketable title to its interest in the inventions claimed under Licensed Patent Rights with the exception of certain retained rights of the United States Government, which may apply if
any part of the JHU research was funded in whole or in part by the United States Government. To the best of JHTT&#146;s knowledge, JHU has the right to grant the rights, and transfer the materials, to Company that are granted and transferred
hereunder on the terms set forth herein. The parties acknowledge that the transfer of the 3SKBR3 cell line from JHU is not possible until Company receives permission for transfer from Memorial Sloan Kettering. If and when such permission is
obtained, then JHU agrees that it will cooperate in such transfer. JHU does not warrant the validity of any patents or that practice under such patents shall be free of infringement. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, COMPANY,
AFFILIATED COMPANIES AND SUBLICENSEE(S) AGREE THAT THE LICENSED IP ARE PROVIDED &#147;AS IS&#148;, AND THAT JHU MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY WITH RESPECT TO THE PERFORMANCE OF LICENSED PRODUCT(S) AND LICENSED SERVICE(S) INCLUDING THEIR
