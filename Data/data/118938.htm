Purchaser, pursuant to this Agreement in any tax year shall not exceed the maximum amount that can be paid to the Purchaser in such year without causing such Protected REIT to fail to meet the REIT Requirements for such year, determined as if the
payment of such amount were Nonqualifying Income as determined by such counsel or independent accountants to such Protected REIT. If the amount payable for any tax year under the preceding sentence is less than the amount which the Person obligated
to make payment under <U>Section&nbsp;8.03</U> would otherwise be obligated to pay to the Seller or the Purchaser, as the case may be, pursuant to such <U>Section&nbsp;8.03</U> of this Agreement (the &#147;<U>Expense Amount</U>&#148;), then:
(1)&nbsp;such obligated Person shall place the Expense Amount into an escrow account (the &#147;<U>Expense Escrow Account</U>&#148;) using an escrow agent and agreement reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser and shall not release any portion thereof
to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser, shall not be entitled to any such amount, unless and until the Purchaser, delivers to such obligated Person, at the sole option of such Protected REIT, (i)&nbsp;an opinion (an &#147;<U>Expense Amount Tax
Opinion</U>&#148;) of such Protected REIT&#146;s tax counsel to the effect that such amount, if and to the extent paid, would not constitute Nonqualifying Income, (ii)&nbsp;a letter (an &#147;<U>Expense Amount Accountant&#146;s Letter</U>&#148;)
from such Protected REIT&#146;s independent accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid at that time to the Purchaser, without causing such Protected REIT to fail to meet the REIT Requirements for any relevant taxable year, or
(iii)&nbsp;a private letter ruling issued by the IRS to such Protected REIT indicating that the receipt of any Expense Amount hereunder will not cause such Protected REIT to fail to satisfy the REIT Requirements (a &#147;<U>REIT Qualification
Ruling</U>&#148; and, collectively with an Expense Amount Tax Opinion and an Expense Amount Accountant&#146;s Letter, a &#147;<U>Release Document</U>&#148;); and (2)&nbsp;pending the delivery of a Release Document by the Purchaser, to such obligated
Person, the Purchaser, shall have the right, but not the obligation, to borrow the Expense Amount from the Escrow Account pursuant to a loan agreement (an &#147;<U>Indemnity Loan Agreement</U>&#148;) reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser, that
(i)&nbsp;requires such obligated Person to lend the Purchaser, immediately available cash proceeds in an amount equal to the Expense Amount (an &#147;<U>Indemnity Loan</U>&#148;), and (ii)&nbsp;provides for (A)&nbsp;a commercially reasonable
interest rate and commercially reasonable covenants, taking into account the credit standing and profile of the Purchaser, as the case may be, or any guarantor of the Purchaser, as the case may be, including such Protected REIT, at the time of such
Indemnity Loan, and (B)&nbsp;a 15 year maturity with no periodic amortization. </P>
