Following the successful development of the Product under the Program, Entegris shall supply the polymer systems of the Product
to Cellect in amounts and price/profit margin that shall be agreed between the Parties at such time. If Entegris defaults on this
obligation, Cellect may find an alternate party for manufacturing the polymer systems in which case Entegris would receive a royalty
of five percent (5%) of the Product final sales, payable by Cellect on a quarterly basis, until the aggregate amount payable hereunder
is equal to the amounts paid by Entegris on account of the Collaboration and Exclusivity Payment. If mutually agreed, Entegris
or its supply chain partners may manufacture the Product in addition to the polymer systems.</P>
