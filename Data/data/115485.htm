Licensor is the owner of the MGM trademark, in plain type and in various formats with and without designs, which are registered on the Principal Register of the United States Patent and Trademark Office for a variety of goods and services (the
&#147;<U>Licensed Mark</U>&#148;); and </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">WHEREAS, Licensor wishes to license to Licensee, and Licensee wishes to obtain from Licensor, a
license to use the Licensed Mark in connection with the name of Licensee and its Subsidiaries (as defined below) and uses incidental to the management and operation of Licensee and its Subsidiaries (the &#147;<U>Licensed Services</U>&#148;). </P>

THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows: </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">1.

at least a majority interest in the Subsidiary. In the event that Licensee grants any sublicense to any of its Subsidiaries as permitted herein, Licensee shall ensure that the Subsidiaries consent to the terms of this Agreement and Licensee shall be
responsible for its Subsidiaries&#146; compliance with the terms of this License. All rights not otherwise licensed to Licensee hereunder are specifically reserved and owned by Licensor, including, without limitation, use of the Licensed Mark in
connection with casino, hotel, and entertainment services, and other related goods and services offered by Licensor or its subsidiaries and affiliates that own or operate resort hotels and casinos. Nothing herein shall preclude Licensee or its
Subsidiaries from using trademarks owned by Licensor in a nominative manner to the extent necessary to identify or refer to Licensor, as permitted by law and provided that such use does not create a likelihood of confusion. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">2. <B><U>Term and Termination</U></B>. The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and continue for fifty (50)&nbsp;years
(&#147;<U>Term</U>&#148;). Licensor may terminate this Agreement during the Term upon thirty (30)&nbsp;days&#146; written notice to Licensee if Licensee or any of its Subsidiaries materially breach this Agreement and fail to cure such breach within
thirty (30)&nbsp;days after receipt of written notice of such breach. Licensee may terminate this Agreement for any reason upon thirty (30)&nbsp;days&#146; written notice to Licensor. Upon termination of this Agreement, all rights and licenses
granted to Licensee pursuant to this Agreement shall immediately and automatically revert to Licensor, Licensee and its Subsidiaries shall no longer be entitled to use the Licensed Mark in any form in any media now known or hereafter invented, and
Licensee and its Subsidiaries shall cease holding themselves out as being licensed by Licensor; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that Licensee and its Subsidiaries shall have thirty (30)&nbsp;days after the effective date of termination to phase out
all uses of the Licensed Mark. </P>

domain name containing the Licensed Mark or a confusingly similar mark or design, unless consistent with the scope of the Licensed Services or permitted in writing by Licensor. In the event that Licensee or any of its Subsidiaries breach this
provision, Licensee hereby grants Licensor an irrevocable limited power of attorney to correct the records and have the application or registration placed in Licensor&#146;s name. </P>
