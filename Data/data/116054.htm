Warrant, the Shares and the Common Stock of the Company have not been registered 
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#147;<B><I>Securities 
Act</I></B>&#148;), and agrees not to sell, pledge, distribute, offer for sale, 
transfer or otherwise dispose of this Warrant, any Shares issued upon its 
exercise or any Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Shares in the absence 
of (i) an effective registration statement under the Securities Act as to this 
Warrant, such Shares or such Common Stock and registration or qualification of 
this Warrant, such Shares or such Common Stock under any applicable U.S. federal 
or state securities law then in effect, or (ii) an opinion of counsel, 
reasonably satisfactory to the Company, that such registration and qualification 
are not required. Each certificate or other instrument for Shares issued upon

Registered Holder may Transfer this Warrant to an Affiliate only upon prior 
written notice to the Company and upon a properly executed assignment (in the 
form of <U>Exhibit B</U> hereto) delivered to the principal office of the 
Company, and, provided further that the permitted transferee agrees in writing 
to be bound by the terms hereof in a manner reasonably acceptable to the 
Company. For purposes of this Warrant, &#147;<B><I>Affiliate</I></B>&#148; means, with 
respect to Registered Holder, any individual, corporation, partnership, trust, 
limited liability company, association or other entity (a 
&#147;<B><I>Person</I></B>&#148;) who, directly or indirectly, controls, is controlled by,

officer or director of such Person or any venture capital fund now or hereafter 
existing that is controlled by one or more general partners or managing members 
of, or shares the same management company with, such Person. Any purported 
Transfer by the Registered Holder of this Warrant in violation of this Section 4 
hereof shall be voidable by the Company. The Company need not register a 
transfer of legended Warrant stock, and may also instruct its transfer agent not 
to register the transfer of the Warrant stock, unless the conditions specified 
in each of the foregoing legends are satisfied.</P>
