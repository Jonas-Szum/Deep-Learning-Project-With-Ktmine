/PRNewswire/ &#151; EB Pharma, LLC., a subsidiary of Eiger BioPharmaceuticals, Inc., today announced that it has executed an agreement with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, (&#147;Janssen&#148;), for an exclusive license, , to tipifarnib in the field of
virology and a related, clinical stage back-up compound. EB Pharma is conducting clinical studies in patients infected with Hepatitis Delta (HDV) and will assess the efficacy and tolerability of tipifarnib as a potential new therapy. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;This novel approach to treating HDV is the culmination of decades of research&#148;, said Jeffrey Glenn, MD, PhD, Scientific Founder and Associate
Professor of Medicine, Stanford University. &#147;I think it has the potential to change the treatment paradigm for the worst form of human viral hepatitis, and offers new hope for these patients.&#148; </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;HDV is the least common but has the poorest outcome of all forms of viral hepatitis&#148;, said David Cory, President and Chief Executive Officer of
Eiger. &#147;We are excited to license tipifarnib from Janssen and study a potential new therapy for this life threatening disease.&#148; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>About
Tipifarnib&nbsp;</B> </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Tipifarnib is a well-characterized, late stage, orally active inhibitor of farnesyl transferase, an enzyme involved in modification
of proteins through a process called prenylation. HDV uses this host cell process inside liver cells to complete a key step in its life cycle. Tipifarnib inhibits the prenylation step of HDV replication inside liver cells and blocks the ability of
the virus to multiply. Since prenylation is a host process, not under control of HDV, and tipifarnib inhibits prenylation, there is also a theoretical higher barrier to resistance with tipifarnib therapy. Virus mutation, a common pathway to drug
resistance, is not expected to be a potential pathway to tipifarnib resistance by HDV. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Tipifarnib is not approved for sale for any indication. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>About HDV </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Hepatitis Delta is caused by infection with
the hepatitis D virus (HDV) and is considered to be the most severe form of viral hepatitis in humans. Hepatitis D occurs only as a co-infection in individuals with hepatitis B (HBV), leads to more severe liver disease than HBV alone, and is
associated with accelerated liver fibrosis, liver cancer, and liver failure. HDV is a disease with a significant impact on global health affecting ~15 million people worldwide. The prevalence of HDV varies
