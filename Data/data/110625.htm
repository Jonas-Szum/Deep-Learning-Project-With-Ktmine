<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>CAMBRIDGE, Mass., March XX, 2015 &#151;</I> BIND Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: BIND), a clinical-stage nanomedicine platform company developing targeted and
programmable therapeutics called Accurins&#153;, today announced an extension of the terms of its global collaboration with Pfizer Inc. to create Accurins that optimize the therapeutic potential of two molecularly targeted oncology drugs in
Pfizer&#146;s pipeline. The collaboration was originally established in April 2013 and the timeline for Pfizer to exercise its option to acquire the exclusive license for the first program continues to be September 2015. Both companies agreed to an
extension of the timeline for the second program through March 2016. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;We have made a great deal of progress in this collaboration and have shown
promising preclinical results with Accurins containing each of the two compounds,&#148; said Andrew Hirsch, president and chief executive officer, BIND Therapeutics. &#147;Pfizer has been a terrific partner and the results to date have provided
evidence that we are on track with the collaboration goals. We mutually agreed to extend the research terms for the second of the two selected compounds in order to ensure it is fully evaluated and well-positioned to enter IND-enabling
studies.&#148; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A development milestone was achieved for the first program in December 2014. The 2015 option target date on the first compound remains
unchanged and this extension allows BIND and Pfizer an additional year to complete preclinical research evaluating the second program. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;Our Accurin
development programs are active and of high interest to both companies,&#148; said Robert Abraham, Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer, Oncology Research Unit, Pfizer. &#147;We are pleased to continue working with BIND under
terms of the amended agreement.&#148; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under terms of the original agreement, Pfizer has the exclusive option to pursue development and commercialization
of the Accurins selected. Both companies will work together on preclinical research, and if Pfizer exercises its option, Pfizer will have responsibility for development and commercialization of the selected Accurins. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">BIND Therapeutics is a clinical-stage nanomedicine platform company developing a pipeline of Accurins, its novel targeted therapeutics designed to increase the
concentration and duration of therapeutic payloads at disease sites while reducing exposure to healthy tissue. BIND is leveraging its Medicinal Nanoengineering platform to develop a pipeline of Accurins targeting hematological and solid tumors and
has a number of strategic collaborations with biopharmaceutical companies to develop Accurins in areas of high unmet need. BIND&#146;s lead drug candidate, BIND-014, is a prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) -targeted Accurin that contains
docetaxel, a clinically-validated and widely-used cancer chemotherapy drug. BIND-014 is currently in development for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, in patients with KRAS mutations or squamous histology. In addition, BIND
plans to initiate clinical trials with BIND-014 in cervical, bladder, head and neck and cholangio cancers in 2015. BIND is also advancing BIND-510, its second PSMA-targeted Accurin drug candidate containing vincristine, a potent microtubule
inhibitor with dose limiting peripheral neuropathy in its conventional form, through important preclinical studies to position it for an Investigational New Drug (IND) application filing with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2016.
Lastly, BIND is developing Accurins designed to inhibit PLK1 and KSP, both of which BIND believes are promising anti-mitotic targets that have been limited in the clinic due to myelotoxicity prior to reaching therapeutic doses. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">BIND has announced ongoing collaborations with Pfizer Inc., AstraZeneca AB, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. and Merck&nbsp;&amp; Co., or Merck (known as Merck
Sharp&nbsp;&amp; Dohme outside the United States and Canada), to develop Accurins based on their proprietary therapeutic payloads and targeting ligands. </P>
