as otherwise contemplated by <U>Article 6</U>, at its option, the indemnifying Party may assume the defense of any Third Party
Claim by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days after the indemnifying Party&rsquo;s receipt of
an Indemnification Claim Notice. The assumption of the defense of a Third Party Claim by the indemnifying Party shall not be construed
as an acknowledgment that the indemnifying Party is liable to indemnify the Indemnified Party in respect of the Third Party Claim,
nor shall it constitute a waiver by the indemnifying Party of any defenses it may assert against the Indemnified Party&rsquo;s
claim for indemnification. Upon assuming the defense of a Third Party Claim, the indemnifying Party may appoint as lead counsel
in the defense of the Third Party Claim any legal counsel selected by the indemnifying Party. In the event the indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall immediately deliver to the indemnifying Party all original
notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party in connection with the Third Party Claim. Should
the indemnifying Party assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, except as provided in <U>Section 9.4.2</U>, the indemnifying

with the analysis, defense or settlement of the Third Party Claim unless specifically requested in writing by the indemnifying

for any and all costs and expenses (including attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs of suit) and any Losses incurred by the indemnifying
