immediately effective upon the Effective Date (as herein defined), and is by and among the entities listed on <B><I><U>Schedule 1-A</U></I></B> attached hereto and made a part hereof by reference and incorporation (collectively, jointly and
severally, the &#147;Lessor&#148;), having their principal office at 1000 Urban Center Drive, Suite 501, Birmingham, Alabama 35242, and the entities listed on <B><I><U>Schedule 1-B</U></I></B> attached hereto and made a part hereof by reference and

<P STYLE="margin-top:24pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center"><B><U>STATEMENT OF INTENT </U></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">Subject to <U>Articles V</U>, <U>XIV</U>, <U>XV</U>, <U>XXX</U> and <U>Section&nbsp;16.1</U>, this Lease constitutes one unitary, indivisible,
non-severable true lease of all the Leased Property. This Lease does not constitute separate leases contained in one document each governed by similar terms. The use of the expression &#147;unitary lease&#148; to describe this Lease is not merely
for convenient reference. It is the conscious choice of a substantive appellation to express the intent of Lessor and Lessee in regard to an integral part of this transaction, which is to accomplish the creation of an indivisible lease. Lessor and
Lessee agree that from an economic point of view the portions of the Leased Property leased pursuant to this Lease constitute one economic unit and that the Rent and all other provisions have been negotiated and agreed to based upon a lease of all
the portions of the Leased Property as a single, composite, inseparable transaction. Except as expressly provided in this Lease for specific isolated purposes (and in such cases only to the extent expressly so stated), all provisions of this Lease,
including definitions, commencement and expiration dates, rental provisions, use provisions, renewal provisions, breach, default, enforcement, termination and assignment and subletting provisions, shall apply equally and uniformly to all the Leased
Property as one unit and are not severable. The economic terms of this Lease would have been substantially different had separate leases or a &#147;divisible&#148; lease been acceptable to Lessor. A default of any of the terms or conditions of this
Lease occurring with respect to any particular Property shall constitute a default under this Lease with respect to all the Leased Property. Except as expressly provided in this Lease for specific isolated purposes (and in such cases only to the
extent expressly so stated), Lessor and Lessee agree that the provisions of this Lease shall at all times be construed, interpreted and applied such that the intention of Lessor and Lessee to create a unitary lease shall be preserved and maintained.
Lessor and Lessee agree that for the purposes of any assumption, rejection or assignment of this Lease under 11 U.S.C. Section&nbsp;365 or any amendment or successor section thereof, this is one indivisible and non-severable lease dealing with and
covering one legal and economic unit which must be assumed, rejected or assigned as a whole with respect to all (and only all) the Leased Property. </P>

Notice (such date identified in a Severance Notice, a &#147;Severance Date&#148;). The Severance Notice shall specify the Severed Property and the Severance Date. Effective upon a Severance Date, the applicable Severed Property shall no longer be
