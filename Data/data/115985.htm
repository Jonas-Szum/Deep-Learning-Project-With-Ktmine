hereunder. The Party requesting an audit (the &#147;<B>Auditing Party</B>&#148;) shall have the right, at its own expense and not more than once in any calendar year during the term of this Agreement, to have an independent, certified public
accountant, selected by the Auditing Party, and under an obligation of confidence, audit the books and records of the other Party (the &#147;<B>Audited Party</B>&#148;) in the location(s) where such books and records are maintained upon reasonable
notice (which shall be no less than fifteen (15)&nbsp;business days prior written notice) and during regular business hours, and for the sole purpose of verifying the basis and accuracy of payments required and made under this Agreement. The report
and communication of such accountant with respect to such an audit shall be limited to a certificate stating whether any, as applicable, report made or reimbursement or other payment submitted during such period is accurate or inaccurate and, if a
discrepancy is identified, shall also indicate the amount and if applicable, with respect to any report, the nature, of any discrepancy, and the correct information (with respect to the applicable period). Such accountant shall provide AnaptysBio
and TESARO with a copy of each such report simultaneously. Should the audit lead to the discovery of a discrepancy: (i)&nbsp;to the Auditing Party&#146;s detriment, the Audited Party shall pay to the Auditing Party the amount of the discrepancy
within thirty (30)&nbsp;days of the Audited Party&#146;s receipt of the report; or (ii)&nbsp;to the Audited Party&#146;s detriment, the Audited Party may, as applicable, credit the amount of the discrepancy against future payments payable to the
Auditing Party under this Agreement, and if there are no such payments payable, then the Auditing Party shall pay to the Audited Party the amount of the discrepancy within thirty (30)&nbsp;days of the Auditing Party&#146;s receipt of the report.
Additionally, in the event that the discrepancy is to the Auditing Party&#146;s detriment and is greater than five percent (5%)&nbsp;of the amount due for such audited period, then the Audited Party shall pay or reimburse the reasonable cost charged
by such accountant for such audit. Once the Auditing Party has conducted an audit permitted by this Section&nbsp;7.4 in respect of any period, it may not re-inspect the Audited Party&#146;s books and records in respect of such period, unless a
subsequent audit of a separate reporting period uncovers fraud on the part of the Audited Party that is reasonably expected to have been occurring during the prior audited period. For clarity, however, if a discrepancy is identified by the
accountant during the course of an audit and the Parties do not agree upon a resolution of such discrepancy, then the Auditing Party&#146;s accountant may re-inspect the books and records to the extent reasonably relevant to resolving such
discrepancy. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, upon the expiration of three (3)&nbsp;years following the end of any calendar year, the right to audit, the books and records for such calendar year shall expire and such Party shall be
released from any liability or accountability with respect to payments or FTE work performed as reflected in such books of such Party for such calendar year (including, for clarity, with respect to the calculation of royalties payable with respect
to each such calendar year). The Parties shall no longer be required to retain such books and records for any calendar year after the expiration of the third (3rd)&nbsp;calendar year following such calendar year. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">WALTHAM, MA, and SAN DIEGO, CA &#150; December&nbsp;2, 2014 &#150; TESARO, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSRO), an oncology-focused biopharmaceutical company, and AnaptysBio,
Inc., a privately-held therapeutic antibody company, today announced an expansion of their immuno-oncology collaboration and exclusive license agreement to include development of a novel bispecific antibody candidate designed to target two
undisclosed immune checkpoints. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">AnaptysBio and TESARO first initiated their collaboration in March of 2014, and have together focused on the development
of monospecific antibody drug candidates targeting TIM-3, LAG-3 and PD-1 and dual reactive antibody drug candidates targeting PD-1/TIM-3 and PD-1/LAG-3. Since the beginning of this partnership, Investigational New Drug (IND) enabling preclinical
studies of TSR-042 (anti-PD-1 antibody candidate) have been initiated, and additional clinical candidates have been identified, including lead candidates targeting TIM-3 and LAG-3. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;Through our collaboration with AnaptysBio, we are employing a variety of approaches, including monospecific, bispecific and dual specific antibodies, to
address some of the most validated and promising immune checkpoint targets,&#148; said Mary Lynne Hedley, president and COO of TESARO. &#147;We are committed to advancing the science of immuno-oncology in order to potentially transform the care of
patients with cancer. Our team looks forward to continued collaboration with AnaptysBio on these programs and to the presentation of data describing our anti-TIM-3 antibody candidate at the AACR conference later today in Orlando.&#148; </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;AnaptysBio continues to focus on the development of therapeutic antibodies for unmet medical needs in immuno-oncology, inflammation and fibrosis. Our
strategic advantage is the ability to rapidly discover and develop therapeutic antibodies against emerging biological targets using the natural somatic hypermutation mechanism encoded within the human immune system,&#148; said Hamza Suria, president
and CEO of AnaptysBio. &#147;We are pleased to expand our collaboration with TESARO, and look forward to advancing multiple immuno-oncology antibodies into the clinic.&#148; </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the terms of this expansion, TESARO will pay AnaptysBio an undisclosed upfront fee and will provide funding for all costs incurred by AnaptysBio related
to the development of a clinical antibody candidate. For each program within the collaboration, AnaptysBio is eligible to receive milestone payments if certain research and development events are achieved and additional payments for achievement of
certain U.S. and ex-U.S. regulatory submissions and approvals in multiple indications. AnaptysBio will also be eligible to receive royalties related to worldwide net sales of products developed under the collaboration, and may earn certain
commercial milestone payments if specified levels of annual worldwide net sales are attained. AnaptysBio and TESARO will together complete preclinical development of the antibody candidates, with </P>
