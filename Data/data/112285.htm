</B> Subject to CPP&rsquo;s prior written approval within thirty (30) days after receiving a written request from TILLOTTS, such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld, of any third party that is proposed by TILLOTTS to act as a Sublicensee, which, for the
avoidance of doubt, excludes any Affiliates of TILLOTTS (as set forth immediately above in SECTION 2.5.1), TILLOTTS may grant to
third parties non-assignable sublicenses in the Licensed Field in the Licensed Territory under the Licenses that comply with this
Agreement. TILLOTTS' right and power to grant sublicenses: (a) is only in effect while the Licenses are in effect and during the
Term and TILLOTTS is not in material breach of this Agreement; and (b) may be exercised only to the extent the Licenses are exclusive
to TILLOTTS. With the exception of Affiliates of TILLOTTS, no third party Sublicensee may have any right or power to grant a further
sublicense. No other or further right or power to sublicense is hereby granted or implied. If this Agreement is terminated, such
Sublicenses may be assigned to CPP in accordance with Section 9.5.</P>

TILLOTTS shall (a) use commercially reasonable efforts to perform due diligence on its potential Sublicensees to evaluate whether
each such potential Sublicensee is in compliance with applicable anti-corruption laws, including the UK Bribery Act, and (b) require
each Sublicensee to comply with applicable anti-corruption laws, including the UK Bribery Act and any corporate anti-corruption
policies of TILLOTTS, TILLOTTS shall cooperate in good faith with CPP with respect to monitoring and enforcing anti-corruption
laws and policies, including providing CPP with access to information obtained from TILLOTTS&rsquo; compliance-related audits of
its Sublicensees. TILLOTTS must provide CPP written notice of the issuance of each Sublicense and a true copy of it within sixty
days after the execution of each Sublicense. All Sublicenses shall be issued in English. In the copy of the Sublicense so provided,
TILLOTTS may redact those portions of the Sublicense that are not required to provide CPP assurance that the Sublicense is in compliance
with this Agreement and that do not otherwise pertain to the terms of this Agreement. Each Sublicense must be in writing and must
include provisions similar in effect and scope in all material respects to those of this Agreement. Each Sublicense must comply
with all applicable laws and governmental regulations. In particular, TILLOTTS may not grant or shall refuse to grant a Sublicense
under any circumstance, term or condition amounting to a misuse of any Licensed Patent. TILLOTTS is responsible for complying with
any obligations in this Agreement based on activities of any Sublicensee, including paying to CPP all earned royalties due in respect
of the activities and Sales of Licensed Product by its Sublicensees. At all times during the Term, TILLOTTS is and will remain
liable for actions or omissions wrongfully made by a party having been granted a Sublicense by TILLOTTS and, if permitted by applicable
laws, must name CPP an intended third-party beneficiary with full rights to: (a) enforce the Sublicensee&rsquo;s obligations thereunder;
and (b) terminate that sublicense for breach of the Sublicense under provisions similar to that provided in Subsections 9.1.2 and
9.1.3. For the avoidance of doubt, CPP can enforce such rights mentioned in (a) and (b) only if TILLOTTS has unreasonably refused
to act against such Sublicensee that is in breach of its obligations itself, meaning that CPP must always discuss and agree on
any actions that it intends to take against a Sublicensee with TILLOTTS first.</P>

and grant to a third party (other than an Affiliate of CPP) a Proposed Outside Field License, CPP must provide TILLOTTS written
notice of that intent, including information whether the envisioned Proposed Outside Field License would be for a Distinct Formulation
or an Interchangeable Formulation in reference to Subsection 2.6.3 (&ldquo;<B><I><U>Outside Field Notice</U></I></B>&rdquo;) before
CPP may solicit third parties to negotiate and take that Proposed Outside Field License. CPP hereby grants TILLOTTS a first right
to negotiate exclusively with CPP regarding any Proposed Outside Field License (the &ldquo;<B><I>Right of First Negotiation</I></B>&rdquo;
or &ldquo;<B><I><U>ROFN</U></I></B>&rdquo;). On or before the date sixty days after TILLOTTS&rsquo; receipt of the Outside Field
Notice, TILLOTTS must provide CPP written notice (the &ldquo;<B><I><U>ROFN Notice</U></I></B>&rdquo;) if TILLOTTS elects to exercise
the ROFN with respect to that Proposed Outside Field License. TILLOTTS can decline the Outside Field Notice in writing or, if TILLOTTS

ROFN with respect to the Proposed Outside Field License and CPP may grant such Proposed Outside Field License to any third party
without further obligation to TILLOTTS except as may be required pursuant to Section 2.6.3; provided, however, that if TILLOTTS
decided to decline the Outside Field Notice or was deemed to decline based on a formulation contained in the applicable Outside
Field Notice, and if such proposed formulation identified in such Outside Field Notice changes from a Distinct Formulation to an
Interchangeable Formulation (or the reverse), then CPP shall provide TILLOTTS an updated Outside Field Notice and TILLOTTS may
provide CPP a new ROFN Notice unless (a) CPP has, before the date of the updated Outside Field Notice, agreed with a third party
to negotiate exclusively with respect to such Proposed Outside Field License, or (b) CPP&rsquo;s provision of an updated Outside
Field Notice would breach CPP&rsquo;s obligations to any third party, including obligations of confidentiality or non-use. In the

a non-binding term sheet (the &ldquo;<B><I><U>ROFN Term Sheet</U></I></B>&rdquo;) specifying the salient terms of the Proposed
Outside Field License. If the ROFN Term Sheet is timely executed, then CPP and TILLOTTS must negotiate in good faith and execute,
on or before the expiration of the Licensed Negotiation Period, the subject Proposed Outside Field License. If: (a) TILLOTTS has
declined or is deemed to have declined to exercise its ROFN with respect to the Proposed Outside Field License; (b) on or before
the expiration of the Term-Sheet Period, CPP and TILLOTTS have not executed the ROFN Term Sheet; or (c) on or before the expiration
of the License Negotiation Period, CPP and TILLOTTS have not executed the pertinent Proposed Outside Field License, then the ROFN
will expire and be of no further effect as regard to the pertinent Outside Field Notice, and CPP may grant such Proposed Outside
Field License to any third party, subject to Subsection 2.6.3; <I>provided</I>, <I>however</I>, that if the terms of such Proposed

the date such ROFR Notice (the &ldquo;<B><I>ROFR Acceptance Period</I></B>&rdquo;) is delivered to accept such terms in writing
and without modification. If TILLOTTS fails to notify CPP of such acceptance before the end of the ROFR Acceptance Period, then
CPP may grant such Proposed Outside Field License to any third party on such terms (or on terms more favorable to CPP), subject
only to TILLOTTS&rsquo; rights under Section 2.6.3.</P>

the Proposed Outside Field License to a third party unless either (i) TILLOTTS provides its written consent to the grant of the
Proposed GID License, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, or (ii) CPP agrees to pay an earned royalty in respect of
the Sales of Licensed Formulation under the Proposed Outside Field License, as provided below. If TILLOTTS does not provide its
written consent within sixty days of CPP&rsquo;s written request therefor, then TILLOTTS must provide, on or before the conclusion
of that sixty-day period, a written analysis that TILLOTTS believes demonstrates that the marketing and Sale of the Interchangeable
Formulation under the Proposed Outside Field License would likely substantially reduce TILLOTTS&rsquo; Sales of the Licensed Formulation
in the Primary Indication in the Licensed Territory. If TILLOTTS fails to timely provide the written analysis, TILLOTTS will be
deemed to have granted its written consent. If, on or before the date thirty days after CPP receives TILLOTTS&rsquo; written analysis,

Sales, then the parties will submit the matter to the Valuation Expert Panel (as defined below), which will promptly determine

binding on the parties. If the Valuation Expert Panel determines that TILLOTTS has failed to reasonably demonstrate that likely
substantial reduction, then CPP will be free to grant the Proposed Outside Field License without TILLOTTS&rsquo; written consent.
If, within the thirty-day period following CPP&rsquo;s receipt of TILLOTTS&rsquo; written analysis, CPP fails to notify TILLOTTS

determination. If the Valuation Expert Panel determines that TILLOTTS failed to demonstrate such likely substantial reduction for
an Interchangeable Formulation, and if such Interchangeable Formulation or a Distinct Formulation that was the subject of a Proposed
Outside Field License is actually launched in the Licensed Territory and TILLOTTS believes that (a) such sales of the Interchangeable
Formulation or such Distinct Formulation have caused an actual reduction of TILLOTTS&rsquo; Sales of the Licensed Formulation in
the Primary Indication Disease in the Licensed Territory of at least [*****]since such Interchangeable Formulation or such Distinct
Formulation, as applicable, was launched compared to an average of the equivalent periods during the immediately prior three years,
this percentage to be understood as a trigger-point for starting the discussion as mentioned immediately herein below, then TILLOTTS
may, at any time between such launch and the date that is twelve months after the first launch (meaning first commercial availability)
of such Interchangeable Formulation or such Distinct Formulation in any country within the Licensed Territory (the &ldquo;<B><I>Post-Launch
Period</I></B>&rdquo;), notify CPP of such actual reduction, including with such notice evidence of such reduction (the &ldquo;<B><I>Reduced
Sales Notice</I></B>&rdquo;). TILLOTTS and CPP shall meet in good faith to discuss whether and to what extent such Sales have been
reduced and the cause(s) of any such reduction. If CPP does not agree with TILLOTTS&rsquo; determination, then, notwithstanding
any prior decision by the Valuation Expert Panel with respect to an Interchangeable Formulation, TILLOTTS may, upon written notice

If, under Paragraph (b) above, CPP concurs, or the Valuation Expert Panel has determined, that TILLOTTS reasonably demonstrated
that the marketing and Sale of the Licensed Formulation under the Proposed Outside Field License will likely substantially reduce

it, nonetheless, elects to solicit third parties and grant to third parties a Proposed Outside Field License, but subject to CPP&rsquo;s
payment of an earned royalty or other compensation in respect of the Sales of Licensed Formulation under the Proposed Outside Field
License. Promptly thereafter, CPP and TILLOTTS must negotiate in good faith the terms of an amendment to this Agreement under which
CPP would pay to TILLOTTS such earned royalty or compensation. Any earned royalty or other compensation will be set at a rate or
level that is designed to compensate TILLOTTS for the reduction in profits associated with the likely or actual (as applicable)
substantial reduction in Sales of Licensed Product in the Licensed Territory. If the parties are unable to agree upon that royalty
rate or other compensation on or before the date sixty days after the date on which CPP submits its first proposal to TILLOTTS,
then the parties must submit the matter to the Valuation Expert Panel for a final determination of that earned royalty or other
compensation as follows: (i) each party must submit its best and final offer to the Valuation Expert Panel along with supporting
evidence and argumentation in the manner established by the Valuation Expert Panel, but no later than thirty days after the appointment
of the final valuation expert to the Valuation Expert Panel; and (ii) the Valuation Expert Panel must award only one or the other
of the two best offers submitted. If an earned royalty rate is part or all of such compensation, CPP will report quarterly on the
sales under the Proposed Outside Field License in the same manner as provided in Subsection 5.7.1 and 5.7.3, <I>mutatis mutandis</I>.</P>

Unless earlier terminated, this Agreement and the Licenses will automatically expire on the date and time at which the Royalty
Term expires for all Licensed Products and for all countries of the Licensed Territory (the <B><I>&ldquo;Term&rdquo;</I></B>).
Upon expiration of this Agreement on a country-by-country and Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product basis, the Licenses in the Licensed
Field <B>will be fully-paid, perpetual and irrevocable</B> only on a country-by-country and Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product
basis in the countries of the Licensed Territory, as then constituted. Expiration or termination of this Agreement does not constitute
a termination or a waiver of any rights of either party against the other party accruing at or prior to the time of expiration
or termination, nor does it terminate or waive either party's surviving obligations under this Agreement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each party&rsquo;s surviving obligations to report and pay to the other party royalties or fees under
this Agreement, if any, shall survive the expiration of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, TILLOTTS must continue to report
until all reconciliations for difference between actuals and estimates of discounts and contra revenue items related to Sales of
Licensed Product before termination or expiration of this Agreement, as required under Subsection 5.7.1, are completely exhausted.</P>

to Companion Diagnostics</U>.</B> In the event that (i) the MA Approval of a Licensed Product contains a restriction and a labeling
requirement or (ii) pricing and reimbursement bodies consider it to be a benefit that the Licensed Product be administered only
after the conduct of an ODC-1 genetic test then CPP grants to TILLOTTS a non-exclusive, non-assignable limited license to Develop,
register, make, Use, Sell, and offer to Sell Diagnostic License Products in the Licensed Territory in support of or in connection
with TILLOTTS&rsquo; Sale of Licensed Products under this Agreement. The parties agree to discuss in good faith in the JSC whether
the Development of a companion diagnostic is advisable and, if so, to discuss in good faith the terms under which CPP would grant
TILLOTTS such a license before the events described in clause (i) and clause (ii) in the previous sentence. A royalty determination
will be discussed in good faith between the parties in due time. If the parties are unable to agree, either party may submit the
royalty determination to the Valuation Expert Panel in accordance with Subsection 2.6.3. CPP remains free to grant to third parties
rights and licenses to develop, market, Use and Sell Diagnostic Licensed Products as a principal part of their business to Develop,
register, market and sell such a companion diagnostic. If the Development of a Diagnostic Licensed Product by such a third party
requires the grant of an exclusive license and the termination of the license granted under this SECTION 2.9, then TILLOTTS may
not unreasonably withhold or delay its consent to the termination thereof. In any case CPP must secure the availability to TILLOTTS
for use and sale by TILLOTTS of a companion diagnostic test in connection with and in support of its Development, registration,
marketing, Use and Sale of Licensed Product.</P>

additional rights hereunder are or may be deemed granted by estoppel or otherwise. In addition to the rights expressly reserved

</B>To the extent not already done, promptly following the Effective Date and from time to time thereafter during the Term, CPP
will timely provide to TILLOTTS the Licensed Information, including all Co-Owned Data (as defined in SECTION 6.1.2.), which CPP
stores in its own digital repository established as part of the Initial Development Plan (the &ldquo;<B><I>CPP Repository</I></B>&rdquo;),
at the times as TILLOTTS may reasonably request. To that end, delivery of Licensed Information will initially be made in read-only
format via the CPP Repository from which Licensed Information, Data (including but not limited to CPP-Owned Data) and any other
clinical or regulatory information to be exchanged between the parties will be made available via electronic transmission and download
to a digital repository that TILLOTTS may, in its discretion, establish (the &ldquo;<B><I>TILLOTTS <U>Repository</U></I></B>&rdquo;).
TILLOTTS shall bear the cost of establishing and maintaining the TILLOTTS Repository and shall control the contents thereof subject
to Section 3.2. TILLOTTS will determine, at its sole discretion with information to CPP, any necessary passwords or user codes
(and changes thereto) that may be necessary to access the TILLOTTS Repository. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, if TILLOTTS terminates this Agreement pursuant to Subsection 9.1.2 for material breach by CPP or pursuant to Subsection
9.1.3 for Financial Default by CPP, then TILLOTTS may continue to have access to the TILLOTTS Repository for as long as the Licenses
remain in effect in accordance with Subsection 9.3.1.B.</P>

and extinguish the provision of any pre-existing non-disclosure agreements between the parties regarding the confidential treatment

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 1in"><B>Subsection 3.2.1. <I>Generally</I>.</B>
The provisions of this SECTION apply to the Licensed Information only, whereas the provisions of SECTION 11.8 apply to any Confidential
Information other than the Licensed Information. Except as expressly permitted under Subsection 3.2.2 below, during the Term of
this Agreement, and at all times thereafter, TILLOTTS must: (a) treat that the Licensed Information as strictly and absolutely
confidential; (b) use the Licensed Information only for purposes expressly permitted under this Agreement. Except as provided in
this Subsection 3.2.1 and Subsection 3.2.2 below, the foregoing obligations and restrictions will expire on the date ten years
after the date on which this Agreement expires or is earlier terminated, except in the case of Licensed Information that CPP maintains
as a trade secret, in which case the term of the foregoing obligations and restrictions will be end on the later of the ten-year
date specified above or on the date on which the Licensed Information ceases to be a trade secret through no fault of TILLOTTS
or those authorized under this Agreement to receive it from TILLOTTS. The foregoing restrictions and obligations do not apply to
that part of Licensed Information that is or becomes generally known to the scientific community and available for its use in seeking
Regulatory Approval of any drug through no fault of TILLOTTS or those to whom it has properly disclosed it under this Agreement,
it being understood that subsequent general knowledge will not excuse an earlier breach of this Agreement. Licensed Information
will not be deemed generally known or available to third parties for use in seeking Regulatory Approval because it is contained
in filings made with a governmental authority of any country, including a Regulatory Authority or any patent authority within the
Licensed Territory, or within any patent or drug regulatory authority of any country outside the Licensed Territory.</P>

of the potential value to TILLOTTS resulting from the confidential nature of certain such Licensed Information, CPP will take reasonable
steps, in its good faith discretion and in close consultation with TILLOTTS, to protect Licensed Information by using the degree
of care that CPP ordinarily uses for such Licensed Information, subject to (a) obligations that CPP may have or rights that third
parties may have, including pursuant to clinical trial site agreements or the Arizona License, to disclose certain Licensed Information,
and (b) CPP&rsquo;s obligations to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including applicable securities laws and the rules
of regulations of applicable securities exchanges as well as following an order of a court of competent jurisdiction or a government
agency properly exercising its delegated authority which compels CPP to disclose Licensed Information; provided, however, that:
(i) the foregoing shall not prevent CPP from disclosing Licensed Information if, in CPP&rsquo;s reasonable business judgment, such
disclosure is appropriate in order to (A) exercise CPP&rsquo;s rights to develop Licensed Formulations outside the Licensed Territory
and within the Licensed Territory outside the Licensed Field, or (B) to provide corporate partners, investors or lenders, or potential
corporate partners, investors, lenders or professional financial analysts, information that CPP deems to be relevant to a potential
corporate transaction, investment in, or loan to, CPP; and (ii) notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, and
recognizing that CPP retains all rights to the Licensed Information outside the Licensed Territory, if CPP materially breaches
this Subsection 3.2.1(a), then TILLOTTS&rsquo; sole remedy for such breach shall be monetary damages or injunctive relief and TILLOTTS
shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement as a result of any breach by CPP of this Subsection 3.2.1(a). For clarity, except
for this Subsection 3.2.1(a), the obligations and procedures described in Section 3.2 do not apply to CPP.</P>

by using the same degree of care as its uses to protect its other similarly sensitive confidential information and trade secrets,
but no less than a reasonable degree of care. TILLOTTS may disclose Licensed Information, and will limit access to Licensed Information,
solely: (a) as may be required to further the purposes of MA Approval of a Licensed Product in the Licensed Territory; (b) to provide
the Licensed Information to any third party in connection with the grant of a Sublicense, but then only if the disclosure or divulgation
is subject to legally binding written obligations and agreement of the Sublicensee to maintain the confidentiality of the Licensed
Information and to limit use of the Licensed Information in a manner and to the extent at least as restrictive as that set forth
in this SECTION; and (c) to those of its trusted Representatives who require the Licensed Information for purposes of TILLOTTS&rsquo;
enjoying the rights and benefits of the License and who are aware of TILLOTTS&rsquo; obligations and restrictions under this Agreement
(each, an &ldquo;<B><I><U>Authorized Representative</U></I></B>&rdquo;). Disclosures to Authorized Representatives must be kept

on access required hereunder and the other measures taken to ensure and confirm limited access must be taken electronically.</P>

is required to disclose one or more elements of the Licensed Information by an order of a court of competent jurisdiction or a
government agency properly exercising its delegated authority, TILLOTTS or that authorized recipient, as the case may be, must
promptly inform CPP in writing of those circumstances, and the parties shall reasonably consult with each other on the steps to
be taken to avoid or restrict the disclosure, and give each other the opportunity to prevent the disclosure, quash the order, or
otherwise contest, defend against or limit the ordered disclosure, provided this information procedure is possible given the deadline(s)
ordered by the court of government agency and at CPP&rsquo;s expense, which includes an indemnification for penalties, which TILLOTTS
might suffer because of CPP&rsquo;s preventative actions. If disclosure of the Licensed Information is nonetheless required, TILLOTTS
or that authorized recipient, as the case may be, must endeavor to put in place reasonable arrangements designed to maintain the
confidentiality and commercial value of the Licensed Information and, in any event, must endeavor to reasonably limit its disclosure
of any Licensed Information pursuant to that order, law or regulation to the minimum required to comply with its terms. Notwithstanding
any permitted disclosure permitted under this Subsection 3.2.3, TILLOTTS must continue to treat the disclosed Licensed Information

must promptly confer as to the course of action to take as may be appropriate under the circumstances to cure the breach and to
mitigate the harm or damage arising from it. In the case of any breach of this SECTION, TILLOTTS must promptly notify the third
party improperly receiving or using the Licensed Information that its receipt or use of the Licensed Information is unlawful and
must request the third party to promptly return all Licensed Information and agree not to further disclose or use it for any purpose.
At its sole cost and expense, TILLOTTS must assist and cooperate with CPP in any reasonable effort of that type. For purposes of
this Agreement and TILLOTTS&rsquo; ongoing obligations to pay earned royalties under this Agreement, any unauthorized disclosure
or use of the Licensed Information by TILLOTTS or any authorized recipient thereof does not reduce TILLOTTS&rsquo; obligations
to pay earned royalties hereunder will continue unaffected and undiminished by any such unauthorized disclosure or use. Any proven
and material breach of the provisions of this SECTION by an Authorized Recipient of any Licensed Information will be deemed a breach
by TILLOTTS of this SECTION. TILLOTTS must promptly pay for or reimburse CPP for any fees, costs and expenses reasonably and directly
incurred by CPP in remedying the unauthorized disclosure or use, for taking any action to protect its rights in, and benefits from,
the Licensed Information improperly disclosed, and to mitigate the damages or harm arising from that improper disclosure.</P>

The Licensed Information is valuable, special and unique, constitutes a trade secret of CPP, and gives CPP a commercial and competitive
advantage because it is not generally known or readily available to the public or those competing with CPP. Thus, if TILLOTTS or
any authorized recipient breaches or threatens to breach any provision of this SECTION, CPP may be irreparably damaged or injured
such that no remedy at law will afford it adequate protection against, or appropriate compensation for, that damage or injury.
Accordingly, notwithstanding SECTION 11.10, CPP may:(a) enforce the provisions of this SECTION by equitable remedies, including
without limitation injunction and specific performance, although those remedies are not the exclusive remedies under this Agreement
but will be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity; and (b) bring (solely with respect to any breach or threatened
breach of this SECTION) any action seeking any of those remedies in any court of the United States or any state having subject
matter jurisdiction. TILLOTTS hereby agrees to submit to the jurisdiction of any such court and hereby waives any claim or defense
that there is an adequate remedy at law for such breach or threatened breach. TILLOTTS hereby waives any requirement for the posting
of any bond or other collateral that may be required to seek equitable relief. TILLOTTS will cause each Sublicense to contain provisions
substantially similar to this SECTION.</P>

agreed in the Initial Development Plan as such plan may be modified in the future. Subject to TILLOTTS&rsquo; timely payment of

of size and resources similar to such party within the pharmaceutical industry to the Development of a pharmaceutical product,
which has similar market potential and is at a similar stage in its development or product life, taking into account issues including
safety and efficacy, product profile, pricing and reimbursement status, the proprietary position of the product in comparison to
other products in a Party&rsquo;s product portfolio, the then prevailing regulatory environment and status with respect hereto
and subject to any prerequisites or conditions specified or implied in the Initial Development Plan that are applicable to a given
task (&ldquo;<B><I><U>Commercially Reasonable Diligence</U></I></B>&rdquo;). However, neither party provides the other party with
any assurance that particular results will be achieved through their respective Commercially Reasonable Diligence under the Initial
Development Plan or that any task will be successfully completed. Accordingly, provided each party exercises Commercially Reasonable
Diligence as required above, the failure to successfully complete any task set forth in the Initial Development Plan or to achieve
certain results does not constitute a breach under this Agreement (even if, in the case of TILLOTTS, it has certain termination
rights with respect to any such failure under Subsection 9.2.1 (Extraordinary Termination Events).</P>

which the combination of Compound 750 mg daily + 150 mg sulindac is more effective than each agent alone in delaying the time to
the first FAP-related event in Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) patients (the &ldquo;<B><I><U>Interim Futility Analysis</U></I></B>&rdquo;)

of the Data Monitoring Committee as defined and established pursuant to the Protocol (the &ldquo;<B><I><U>DMC</U></I></B>&rdquo;).
TILLOTTS shall nominate one member of the DMC, subject to CPP&rsquo;s consent not to be unreasonably withheld, and subject to applicable

the statement of the DMC (such reports, collectively, the &ldquo;<B><I><U>Interim Analysis Report</U></I></B>&rdquo;) that CPP

on CPP&acute;s prepared eCTD (or equivalent as is acceptable to TILLOTTS), and to obtain MA Approval in regard to the Licensed
Formulation and the Primary Indication in the countries of the Licensed Territory. TILLOTTS must exercise Commercially Reasonable

respond to any requests by Regulatory Authorities in connection with those submissions and their review. TILLOTTS must exhaust
all administrative remedies reasonably available (it being understood that litigation or other adversarial proceedings are not
reasonably available remedies) in instances of adverse action by the EMA. TILLOTTS may elect not to submit an MA for the Licensed

is reasonably possible. Subject to Subsection 4.1.10 below with respect to Japan, either party may request that the filing of the
MA in the Licensed Territory be deferred if: (i) the party requesting deferral demonstrates to the other party&rsquo;s reasonable
satisfaction that because of changes in regulatory requirements since the date of the conclusion of the Phase III Trial, the prospects
for obtaining MA Approval or favorable pricing decisions from the applicable Regulatory Authorities would substantially improve

satisfaction that it is necessary to conduct additional studies to obtain MA Approval of the Licensed Formulation in the Licensed
Territory, in which event the parties must promptly commence good faith discussions to inform each other regarding the need and
purposes of those studies and to develop and agree upon a protocol to govern them and the parties&rsquo; respective obligations
for paying for them, it being understood that neither party is obligated to agree upon the protocol or to pay for or contribution
to the cost of those additional studies. Notwithstanding TILLOTTS&rsquo; election not to submit an MA based on the JSC&rsquo;s
recommendation regarding the results of the Phase III Trial, or TILLOTTS&rsquo; request that the MA submission be deferred as provided
in clauses (i) or (ii) above, CPP may submit an MA for acceptance by the Regulatory Authorities without deferral and any related
filings at its own expense. If MA Approval is obtained based on those filings, then CPP will, at TILLOTTS&rsquo; expense, assign
any resultant MA Approvals to TILLOTTS, at TILLOTTS&rsquo; expense, and TILLOTTS must reimburse CPP the cost of those submissions
and filings promptly after TILLOTTS receives CPP&rsquo;s statement, with supporting documentation, for the expenses thereof.</P>

or a study described in clause (ii) of Subsection 4.1.4(a); (b) any study or other activity that a party demonstrates to the other
party&rsquo;s reasonable satisfaction may be necessary to qualify a second source of manufacture in furtherance of the intents

requests as a condition to obtaining regulatory, reimbursement or pricing approval of the Licensed Product (collectively, the &ldquo;<B><I><U>Additional
Studies</U></I></B>&rdquo;). If either party wishes to conduct an Additional Study described in clause (a) above, or deems it necessary,
in its reasonable opinion, for purposes of optimizing the commercial development and prospects of the Licensed Formulation, or,
if an Additional Study described in clause (b) or (c) above is required by the EMA the FDA, or other relevant authorities that
grant, directly or indirectly, MA Approvals, pricing and/or reimbursement approval, upon written request by either party, the parties
must promptly commence good faith discussions to inform each other regarding the need and purposes of such a study and to develop
and agree upon a protocol to govern such a study. If the parties agree to conduct such a study, and neither party may unreasonably
withheld its agreement to do so, then the costs of conducting that study will be shared by the parties in the manner and to the
extent they may mutually determine. The cost of an Additional Study will not be included in the determination of Total Development
Costs. If CPP funds more than a majority of the cost of conducting that study, the data and results from that study will be deemed
CPP-Owned Data; if TILLOTTS funds a majority of the cost of conducting that study, the data and results from the study will be
deemed TILLOTTS-Owned Data; if CPP and TILLOTTS equally contribute to funding the cost of conducting that study, then the data
and results from that study will be deemed to be jointly owned by CPP and TILLOTTS. If a party initially elects to fund less than
half of the cost of conducting that study, that party may elect, without additional cost or charge, any time before the commencement
of that study to fund the cost of that study equally with the other party. For the avoidance of doubt, in order to be able to freely
use the data from the initial majority funding party, the other party has to share [*****] of the corresponding costs, unless the
parties agree otherwise.</P>

<I>Frequency of Reports.</I></B> On or before February 29, May 31, August 31, and October 31 of each calendar year during the
term of this Agreement, TILLOTTS must deliver to CPP a true and complete written report showing the items specified in Subsection
5.7.3 below as they pertain to TILLOTTS&rsquo; and its Sublicensees&rsquo; activities under this Agreement in the calendar quarter
just ended. A responsible financial officer of TILLOTTS (or his or her authorized designee), TILLOTTS&rsquo; independent accounting
firm, or the head of TILLOTTS&rsquo; internal audit committee must certify in writing that each report delivered under this Subsection
5.7.1 is correct and complete. TILLOTTS&rsquo; payment of the earned royalties based on the activities in the calendar quarter
covered by each written report must be wired to CPP&rsquo;s account in accordance with SECTION 5.8 on or before the date that
is three (3) days after the date on which the report is due. If no earned royalties are due, TILLOTTS must so report. TILLOTTS
must require each Sublicensee to make appropriate reports and payments to TILLOTTS to enable it to comply with this Subsection
5.7.1. If, in determining the Net Sales Value for purposes of calculating earned royalties payable hereunder, TILLOTTS applies
any discounts to billing based on estimated discounts or contra revenue items, those estimates must be reconciled to amounts actually
realized or applied. Any such reconciliation must be reflected in the reports to be made immediately after the reconciliation
is made, in which event TILLOTTS will apply as a credit against earned royalties due in that subsequent report any earlier overpayment
determined as a result of the reconciliation and TILLOTTS must pay, in addition to the earned royalties shown in the subsequent
report, any earlier underpayment of earned royalties or Sales Milestone Payments determined as a result of the reconciliation.</P>

<I>Books and Records</I>.</B> TILLOTTS must keep complete and accurate books in accordance with local laws and reasonable supporting

by an independent auditor nominated by CPP and reasonably acceptable to TILLOTTS thereafter if they are reasonably available.
Once per calendar year and during TILLOTTS&rsquo; normal business hours, such an independent auditor may audit and inspect those
books and documentation to verify the accuracy of the content of TILLOTTS&rsquo; quarterly reports and earned royalty statements

in accordance with local laws and reasonable supporting documentation to determine the accuracy of the TILLOTTS Audit Matters.
CPP must keep those books and documentation at its principal place of business for five years following the end of the calendar
year to which they pertain, except that, in the case of TILLOTTS Audit Matters described in clauses (a) and (b) above, CPP may
earlier dispose of those books and documentation upon completion of TILLOTTS&rsquo; inspection, if any. CPP may not deny TILLOTTS&rsquo;

TILLOTTS Audit Matter described in clauses (a) or (b) above discloses a discrepancy between the amounts determined by CPP and
the amounts determined by TILLOTTS&rsquo; independent auditor and, in the case of clause (a) would result in a potential overpayment

Licensed Patent, as provided below, the Authorized Party has the obligation and final decision-making authority: (a) for directing
and paying for the filing, prosecution and maintenance of any Licensed Patent (in the case of CPP) or TILLOTTS Patent Rights (in
the case of TILLOTTS); and (b) in making any election or payment in connection therewith, including whether and in which country(ies)
to seek patent protection. For the avoidance of doubt and in the event that non-Authorized Party wishes to seek a broader patent
protection than the Authorized Party, the non-Authorized shall have the right, at its expense, to seek such broader protection
in the countries in which it has an exclusive license under this Agreement provided that such actions do not, in the reasonable
good faith judgment of the Authorized Party after consultation with non-Authorized Party, conflict with the Authorized Party&rsquo;s
patent strategy in the territory where the Authorized Party retains rights or put the Authorized Party&rsquo;s patents outside
the such territory at risk of being found invalid or unenforceable. The Authorized Party shall carry out all administrative action
in this regard as may be reasonably necessary to permit the non-Authorized Party to exercise such rights. Errors or omissions
of the patent counsel chosen by the Authorized Party shall not be considered a material breach of this Agreement. However, the
Authorized Party shall reasonably pursue all remedies to recover damages, and any damages so awarded will be equally divided by
the parties. In the event that the Authorized Party does not wish to pursue such remedies, the non-Authorized Party shall have
the right to pursue all remedies and shall be able to keep all damages awarded for its own accounts.</P>

Term Extensions and Term Restoration</U>. </B>TILLOTTS must reasonably cooperate with CPP in seeking any available extension or
restoration of the term of any Licensed Patent. TILLOTTS&rsquo; cooperation includes supplying CPP with any information, and the
right to use and file that information with any Regulatory Authority, reasonably requested by CPP that is in TILLOTTS&rsquo; possession
or control that CPP reasonably considers to pertain to, or be desirable for, the extension or restoration of the term of any Licensed
Patent, and must use commercially reasonable efforts to provide CPP in a timely manner with any supporting affidavits or documents
that are requested by CPP and are required in connection with any such term extension or term restoration. For the avoidance of
doubt and in the event that TILLOTTS wishes to seek a term extension or term restoration after all, TILLOTTS shall have the right,
at its expense, to seek such extension or restoration, provided that TILLOTTS does not prejudice any of CPP&rsquo;s rights in
the Licensed Patent or any other of CPP patents, as the case may be. CPP shall carry out all administrative action in this regard
as may be reasonably necessary to permit the TILLOTTS to exercise such rights. CPP may, in its sole discretion, elect not to seek
to extend the term of any Licensed Patent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, TILLOTTS must use its commercially
reasonable efforts to: (a) advise CPP in a timely manner of any MA Approval with respect to a Licensed Product and any other governmental
approval as may be reasonably requested by CPP that is pertinent to any extension or restoration of the patent term of any Licensed
Patent; (b) execute and deliver to CPP, in a timely manner, any authorizations, supporting affidavits and other documents as may
be reasonably requested by CPP in connection with the extension of any Licensed Patent; and (c) take such other actions as may
be reasonably requested by CPP to obtain any extension or restoration. TILLOTTS must require its Affiliates and Sublicensee to
comply with this SECTION 6.6. To the extent the law of any country within the Licensed Territory permits the extension of multiple
patents covering a Licensed Product, and if TILLOTTS wishes to seek an extension of one or more patents within the TILLOTTS Patent
Rights, CPP will have the same obligations (but also the rights) with respect to TILLOTTS Patent Rights as TILLOTTS has under
this SECTION 6.6 with respect to Licensed Patents.</P>

the right to past and future damages caused by the Infringing Activities. At the meeting, the parties will endeavor to designate
the party responsible for taking any such action, the payment and sharing of costs in addressing the Infringing Activities, legal
representation, sharing of awards, and other matter as may be reasonably desirable to address the matter at hand. The parties
may agree to pursue the matter jointly, or to appoint a responsible party. The foregoing agreements of the parties will be reflected

of the Licensed Patents; (b) that right does not necessarily extend to TILLOTTS, except to the extent expressly granted in this
Agreement; and (c) CPP has no duty to pursue infringers. CPP has the exclusive right in the first instance, but not the obligation,
to prosecute in its own name any infringement of the Licensed Patent and misappropriation of Licensed Information, and to defend
any proceeding alleging invalidity or non-infringement of any of the Licensed Patents. If CPP initiates or conducts any legal
proceedings to enjoin or seek damages caused by the Infringing Activities or any other relief or remedy in response to the Infringing
Activities, TILLOTTS must fully cooperate with CPP in that effort, including joining as a party in the proceeding, if required
by applicable law for CPP to bring or maintain any such action. TILLOTTS may join in such proceedings, through its own counsel
and at its own expense, although CPP will have sole control over those proceedings. In the event that in a country of the Licensed
Territory certain very short deadlines have to be kept in order to prosecute an Infringer, the parties shall enter into an accelerated
convening process in order to act before the expiration of such short deadline in order not to lose any procedural rights the
parties may have in that respective country. For the purpose of additionally securing the procedural rights, CPP as the owner
of the Licensed Patent shall issue a letter of authorization to TILLOTTS in a form to be mutually agreed, which shall be held
in escrow by TILLOTTS, so that, if reconvening with CPP is not possible in order to act before the expiration of such short deadline,
TILLOTTS may act on its own and in good faith against such Infringer. If TILLOTTS takes any action pursuant to its authority under
such letter, then TILLOTTS shall notify CPP in writing of such action as soon as possible (but in no event later than ten (10)
days after such action), including in such notice a detailed description of the facts, legal requirements and actions taken, together
with a copy of any correspondence with third parties or legal filings. With respect to TILLOTTS Patent Rights, and to the extent
permissible under the law of the applicable country issuing such TILLOTTS Patent Right, CPP will have the same rights and obligations
with respect to TILLOTTS Patent Rights as TILLOTTS has under this Section 7.2 with respect to Licensed Patents.</P>

an Infringer that is reasonably acceptable to the other party and, in the case of activities described in clauses (a) or (b) of

products or (ii) a reasoned explanation for why such infringing activities are of sufficient strategic concern to merit a response
even if they do not yet involve Significant Quantities; and (b) CPP has not caused the Infringing Activities to terminate, or
has not initiated legal proceedings (which include lawsuits, settlement discussions, mediation, and arbitration) against the Infringer
based on the Infringing Activities, on or before the date 120 days after the date of the SECTION 7.1 meeting, then TILLOTTS has
the right, but not the obligation, to: (a) notify the Infringer that its activities are or may constitute infringement of a Patent
Claim or misappropriation of Licensed Information and that the infringement and misappropriation must cease; (b) prosecute, in
its own name, any infringement action of the Licensed Patents; and (c) defend any action attacking the validity, enforceability
or scope of the Licensed Patents. If the infringement is of the type that, under applicable laws or regulations, requires CPP
to commence proceedings in less than 120 days, the 120-day period referred to above will be reduced to one-half of the period
specified in the applicable laws or regulation. If the parties agree that a temporary restraining order or its equivalent is required,
the 120-day period will be reduced to 10 business days. The foregoing right granted to TILLOTTS does not preclude CPP from exercising,
at any time, any right it may have as assignee or licensee of the Licensed Patents and Licensed Information. With respect to TILLOTTS

customers or prospective customers. TILLOTTS must notify CPP, in writing, whether TILLOTTS elects to prosecute the Infringing
Activities or defend any action involving the Licensed Patents or the Licensed Information. Any suit brought or defended by TILLOTTS
under this SECTION 7.3 is expressly subject to SECTIONS 7.4 through 7.8, inclusive. During the preparation and pendency of any

products were Sold by the Infringer, but not more than one-half of the total amount awarded; and (c) TILLOTTS may keep for its
own account the balance of the amounts awarded as damages. If, CPP does join in a proceeding brought by TILLOTTS, then each party
will be entitled to keep any damages expressly awarded and allocated to it after TILLOTTS proportionally recovers from each party&rsquo;s
award an amount equal to the out-of-pocket expenses and costs it incurred in the course of that proceeding. If, in a proceeding
brought by TILLOTTS in which CPP joins as a party plaintiff, damages are awarded, then from the total of any damages awarded to
the parties severally or jointly: (i) TILLOTTS will first receive an amount equal to the out-of-pocket expenses and costs it incurred
in the course of that proceeding and, if an award is made to TILLOTTS and CPP, then the recovery will be made from the awards to
each party in the proportion of the awards; and (ii) the parties will share any amount remaining equally.</P>

of such party as a solvent corporation and the resulting corporation, if a different legal entity, undertakes with the other party
to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, a Financial Default includes circumstances
in which a party: (a) is unable to pay its debts as they mature or admits in writing its inability to pay its debts as they mature;
(b) makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors; (c) files a voluntary petition for bankruptcy or has filed against
it an involuntary petition for bankruptcy that is not discharged or dismissed within ninety days after the date of the involuntary
filing; or (d) applies for the appointment of a receiver or trustee for substantially all of its assets or permits the assignment
of any such receiver or trustee who is not discharged within a period of ninety days after such appointment. A Financial Default
constitutes a material breach of this Agreement and, upon the occurrence of a Financial Default, the party not suffering from Financial
Default may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the breaching party.</P>

the other party&rsquo;s prior written consent, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. CPP may assign this Agreement,
and TILLOTTS, if it is not then in default under this Agreement, may assign this Agreement, without the non-assigning party's prior
written consent, to: (i) any business entity with which it merges or consolidates; (ii) any business entity purchasing all, or
substantially all, of assigning party&rsquo;s assets or business; or (iii) its Affiliates. In the case of an assignment of this
Agreement pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, the assigning party must, nonetheless, give the non-assigning party prior
written notice of that assignment and require and cause the successor business entity to sign and deliver a written agreement,
in form and substance satisfactory to non-assigning party, expressly to assume and agree to perform this Agreement, to abide by
its terms, and assume the obligations of the assigning party in the same manner and to the same extent that the assigning party
would be required to perform if no succession had taken place. When properly assigned, this Agreement will be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties, their respective successors and assigns.</P>

divulge or otherwise communicate it or any portion of it to any third party, except to its directors, officer, employees, agents,
investors, potential investors, acquirers, potential acquirers, licensees, potential licensees, advisors (accounting, legal and

party&rsquo;s obligations under this Agreement. The receiving party further agrees to exercise every reasonable precaution to prevent
and restrain the unauthorized disclosure of such Confidential Information by any of its directors, officers, employees and agents.
The provisions of this SECTION 11.8 do not apply to Confidential Information that: (a) at the time of receipt by a party, was independently

to the receiving party by a third party having the lawful right to do so without breaching any obligation of nonuse or confidentiality;
or (d) is shown by competent documentary evidence to have been independently developed by the receiving party. The provisions of
Subsections 3.2.3 through 3.2.5 are incorporated herein by this reference, but as applied to Confidential Information disclosed
by one party to another hereunder, <I>mutatis mutandis</I>. Confidential Information will be deemed to be owned by the party who
disclosed it.</P>

as follows: (a) if the Licensed Product is Sold by TILLOTTS or a Sublicensee to a third party that is not a Related Party, actual
billings will be TILLOTTS&rsquo; or that Sublicensee&rsquo;s actual gross invoice amounts, as the case may be; (b) if the Licensed
Product is Sold by TILLOTTS or a Sublicensee to a Related Party for subsequent Sale, actual billings will be that Related Party&rsquo;s
actual gross invoice amounts for that subsequent Sale. Actual billings will be determined based on Licensed Products Sold in a
dosage form suitable for final usage by the administering physician or other consumer. If not Sold in that form, actual billings
will be determined by converting the quantity of Licensed Product actually Sold into the quantity that would have been Sold in
final dosage form and multiplying that adjusted quantity by the customary unit price for Licensed Products Sold in each pertinent
country in final dosage form. When factually applicable or taken, the following deductions shall be deducted from actual billings
as determined above: (i) sales taxes, use taxes, duties or other governmental charges imposed upon particular sales to the extent
included as a separate charge in the amount of actual billings; (ii) amounts allowed or credited on rejections or returns, including
recalls (to the extent such Licensed Product is not replaced by the supplier); (iii) normal and customary discounts, including
cash discounts, discounts to payors, health insurances or similar organizations or government organizations, rebates paid, credited,
accrued or actually taken, including chargebacks, and mandated retroactive price reductions or adjustments made under TILLOTTS&rsquo;
programs designed to enhance availability of the Licensed Product to low-income patients, in each case to the extent actually allowed
or granted from the billed amount; (iv) charges for freight, postage, shipping, freight allowances and outbound transportation
costs, including respective insurances, paid to the extent included as a separate charge in the amount of the actual billings;
and (v) actual uncollectible accounts receivables (to the extent reflected in TILLOTTS&rsquo; books). Billings and deductions will
be determined in accordance with the accrual method of accounting in accordance with the principles of the International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS), applied on a consistent basis. No other allowance or deduction may be made, including allowances or
deductions for any commissions or sales fees by whatever name known. For purposes of converting to U.S. Dollars Net Sales Value
on invoice prices in currencies other than U.S. Dollars, TILLOTTS must first determine the Net Sales Value in TILLOTTS functional
currency, by converting the pertinent foreign currency, thereafter convert such values into U.S. Dollars and then determine the
earned royalty payable on a Licensed Product in United States currency at the average daily exchange rate for that foreign and
that functional currency over the calendar quarter in which the Sale is made, determined by reference to the Currency Converter

Related Party, actual billings will be TILLOTTS&rsquo; or that Sublicensee&rsquo;s actual gross invoice amounts, as the case may
be; (b) if the Licensed Product is Sold by TILLOTTS or a Sublicensee to a Related Party for subsequent Sale, actual billings will
be that Related Party&rsquo;s actual gross invoice amounts for that subsequent Sale. Actual billings will be determined based on
Licensed Products Sold in a dosage form suitable for final usage by the administering physician or other consumer. If not Sold
in that form, actual billings will be determined by converting the quantity of Licensed Product actually Sold into the quantity
that would have been Sold in final dosage form and multiplying that adjusted quantity by the customary unit price for Licensed
Products Sold in each pertinent country in final dosage form. When factually applicable or taken, the following deductions shall
be deducted from actual billings as determined above: (i) sales taxes, use taxes, duties or other governmental charges imposed
upon particular sales to the extent included as a separate charge in the amount of actual billings; (ii) amounts allowed or credited
on rejections or returns, including recalls (to the extent such Licensed Product is not replaced by the supplier); (iii) normal
and customary discounts, including cash discounts, discounts to payors, health insurances or similar organizations or government
organizations, rebates paid, credited, accrued or actually taken, including chargebacks, and mandated retroactive price reductions
or adjustments made under TILLOTTS&rsquo; programs designed to enhance availability of the Licensed Product to low-income patients,
in each case to the extent actually allowed or granted from the billed amount; (iv) charges for freight, postage, shipping, freight
allowances and outbound transportation costs, including respective insurances, paid to the extent included as a separate charge
in the amount of the actual billings; and (v) actual uncollectible accounts receivables (to the extent reflected in TILLOTTS&rsquo;
books). Billings and deductions will be determined in accordance with the accrual method of accounting in accordance with the principles
of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), applied on a consistent basis. No other allowance or deduction may be
made, including allowances or deductions for any commissions or sales fees by whatever name known. For purposes of converting to
U.S. Dollars Net Sales Value on invoice prices in currencies other than U.S. Dollars, TILLOTTS must first determine the Net Sales
Value in TILLOTTS&rsquo; functional currency, by converting the pertinent foreign currency, thereafter convert such values into
U.S. Dollars and then determine the earned royalty payable on a Licensed Product in United States currency at the average daily
exchange rate for that foreign and that functional currency over the calendar quarter in which the Sale is made, determined by
reference to the Currency Converter Table (fxDaily&reg;) published by oanda.com. If Subsection 9.3.4(b) is applicable, then the
