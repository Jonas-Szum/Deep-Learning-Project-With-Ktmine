new formulation will require an animal study to demonstrate lack of irritability of the administration and the absorption of the drug substance. Preparation of study drug is not included in the cost estimates. The Phase 1 study could potentially
compare the sublingual formulation to oral or iv doses. Assuming the data from the study is clean, Phase 2 could proceed. There is a possibility that additional studies will be required to examine any cardiac issues. For marketing reasons, these
might be helpful. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Phase 2 studies for acute migraine (moderate to severe) are shown in Table 2. The Phase 2 study would include an initial study to

animals have been dosed in a regulatory 2 week intravenous study defining a NOAEL dose and that an intravenous study has been done in subjects defining the PK in man and that the dosage form planned for use in man is sublingual (or oral), the first
clinical pharmacology study will be single dose escalation to find the maximal tolerated dose in man. There would be a minimum of two groups of 8 subjects, each dosed at two dosage levels. The kinetics of the sublingual dosing should be compared to
the IV dosing as the study progresses to help define the maximal tolerated dose. You will notice in the table below that there are additional arms of the study, which would likely be beneficial. If the clinical trials use multiple dosing, a multiple
dose clinical pharmacology trial will be required to demonstrate pharmacokinetics and safety at steady state. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The POC clinical study would be in moderate
to severe acute migraine which will use a single dose. Patients who meet the study criteria are given blinded study drug to take with their next moderate or severe migraine headache. They subsequently complete a diary recording the severity of their
symptoms at defined times over the next several hours. This study would use study drug at the maximum tolerated dose and placebo. Efficacy in this trial would be sufficient to move forward. </P>

efficacy study requiring up to 1 week of dosing should be sufficient for a proof of concept trial. </P>
