at any time with prior notice to the other Party, <I>provided</I>, that such replacement is of comparable authority and scope of

the JPC is able to effectuate all of its decisions within the scope of its responsibilities. Licensee shall select one of its representatives

mutually agree, <I>provided</I>, that, unless the Parties agree otherwise, the JPC shall meet at least semi-annually during the

Licensee&rsquo;s material breach, and that monetary damages would not be adequate compensation for any loss incurred by reason

If any provision hereof should be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the Parties shall negotiate in good
faith a valid, legal and enforceable substitute provision that most nearly reflects the original intent of the Parties and all
other provisions hereof shall remain in full force and effect in such jurisdiction and shall be liberally construed in order to
carry out the intentions of the Parties as nearly as may be possible. Such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not
affect the validity, legality or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction. If a Party seeks to avoid a provision
of this Agreement by asserting that such provision is invalid, illegal or otherwise unenforceable, the other Party shall have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section&nbsp;9.2 upon sixty (60) days prior written notice to the asserting Party,
unless such assertion is eliminated and cured within such sixty (60) day period.</P>

an employment, agency or any other relationship. Except as may be specifically provided herein, neither Party shall have any right,

civil commotion, war, terrorist acts, strike, flood, change of law, political unrest, or governmental acts or restriction, or other
cause that is beyond the reasonable control of the respective Party. The Party affected by such force majeure will provide the
other Party with full particulars thereof as soon as it becomes aware of the same (including its best estimate of the likely extent
and duration of the interference with its activities), and will use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to overcome the difficulties
created thereby and to resume performance of its obligations as soon as practicable. If the performance of any such obligation
under this Agreement is delayed owing to such a force majeure for any continuous period of more than one hundred eighty (180) days,
the Parties will consult with respect to an equitable solution, including the possibility of the mutual termination of this Agreement.</P>

drug products come with strong intellectual property protection and significant technology barriers. We are currently preparing
the import drug registration applications in greater China, initially for ZEVALIN and MARQIBO, and since both drugs are approved
for sale in the U.S., we anticipate that confirmatory clinical trials will be required for marketing approval in our territory.
The submission of the import drug registration for CE melphalan will follow immediately after its approval by the U.S. FDA. The
annual incidence in China for NHL, ALL and multiple myeloma is increasing each year with high mortality rates, it is our goal to
have these innovative products available to patients in greater China as soon as possible to address these unmet medical needs,
and as Spectrum expands these drugs into additional indications in the U.S., we too will apply for expanded labels in our territory.&rdquo;</P>

melphalan is a novel intravenous formulation of melphalan being investigated for the multiple myeloma transplant setting, for which
it has been granted an Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA. This formulation eliminates the use of propylene glycol, which has been
reported to cause renal and cardiac side effects that limit the ability to deliver higher doses of therapeutic compounds. The use
of the Captisol technology to reformulate melphalan also improves its stability and is anticipated to allow for slower infusion
rates and longer administration durations, potentially enabling clinicians to safely achieve a higher dose intensity for pre-transplant
chemotherapy.</P>

a patent-protected, chemically modified cyclodextrin with a structure designed to optimize the solubility and stability of drugs.
Captisol was invented and initially developed by scientists in the laboratories of Dr. Valentino Stella at the University of Kansas&rsquo;
Higuchi Biosciences Center for specific use in drug development and formulation. This unique technology has enabled seven FDA-approved
products, including Onyx Pharmaceuticals&rsquo; Kyprolis<SUP>&reg;</SUP>, Baxter International&rsquo;s Nexterone<SUP>&reg;</SUP>&nbsp;and
Merck&rsquo;s NOXAFIL IV. There are also more than 30 Captisol-enabled products currently in clinical development.</P>
