Each Party agrees that it shall not, and that it shall cause each of its Affiliates or representatives not to, file or otherwise
bring any action or lawsuit alleging patent infringement against the other Party for a period of three (3) years after the Effective
Date of this Agreement or until the termination of this Agreement, whichever is earlier (&ldquo;Standstill Period&rdquo;). Nothing
in this Section 2.6 shall enlarge or otherwise modify the licenses, releases, or covenants set out in this Agreement. The foregoing
provision is personal to the Parties, is non-assignable (except as set forth in Section 5.2), and does not apply to any other Person.
Further, it shall not prevent either Party from engaging in discussions with the other Party or any other Person regarding the
licensing of its patents or from enforcing its patents against any Person other than a Party. During this Standstill Period, any
patent infringement claim that one Party has against the other shall be tolled and any damages will accrue and be recoverable to
the full extent permitted by 35 U.S.C. &sect; 286. For clarity, nothing shall prevent the Parties from seeking damages after the
Standstill Period terminates for patent infringement occurring during the Standstill. If either Party violates this Standstill
agreement, the other Party shall be free to immediately end the Standstill Period. If a complaint for patent infringement is filed
after expiration of the Standstill Period, no Party may rely on the Standstill Period as a basis for any claim, counterclaim, or
defense, including without limitation an assertion of laches or to defend against an injunction. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
a Party still may assert any claim, counterclaim, or defense available, including without limitation an assertion of laches or
a defense against an injunction, to the extent it does not specifically rely on the Standstill Period as a basis. For the avoidance
of doubt, nothing in this provision or any other provision of this Agreement shall prevent either Party from intervening in patent
litigation between the other Party and a Third Party based on any indemnity or other contractual obligation that either Party owes
to such Third Party.</P>
