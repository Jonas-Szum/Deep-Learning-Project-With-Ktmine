against LICENSEE, LICENSEE shall promptly notify UNIVERSITY thereof in writing, setting forth the facts of such claim in reasonable detail. As between the parties to this LICENSE AGREEMENT, LICENSEE shall have the first and primary right and
responsibility at its own expense to defend and control the defense of any such claim against LICENSEE, by counsel of its own choice. It is understood that any settlement, consent judgment or other voluntary disposition of such actions must be
approved by UNIVERSITY, such approval not being unreasonably withheld. Subject to the policies of the Board of Governors of the University of North Carolina, UNIVERSITY agrees to cooperate with LICENSEE in any reasonable manner deemed by LICENSEE to
be necessary in defending any such action. LICENSEE shall reimburse UNIVERSITY for any out of pocket expenses incurred in providing such assistance. </P>

the obligation, to institute, prosecute and control any action or proceeding with respect to such infringement, by counsel of its choice, including any declaratory judgment action arising from such infringement. It is understood that any settlement,
consent judgment or other voluntary disposition of such actions must be approved by UNIVERSITY, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld. If LICENSEE recovers monetary damages then such damages awarded shall first be applied to reimbursement of
legal fees and expenses incurred by either party, and the remainder shall be divided between the parties as follows: (A)&nbsp;if the monetary damages are in the form of lost profits from a third party infringer, then (i)&nbsp;LICENSEE shall receive
an amount equal to the damages the court determines LICENSEE has suffered as a result of the infringement less the amount of any royalties that would have been due to UNIVERSITY, and (ii)&nbsp;UNIVERSITY shall receive an amount equal to the
royalties it would have received if not for the infringement; and (B)&nbsp;if LICENSEE recovers monetary damages in the form of a reasonable royalty, then LICENSEE shall remit to UNIVERSITY [**] percent ([**] %) of the reasonable royalty awarded.

(60)&nbsp;days of receiving notice that an infringement exists. UNIVERSITY may, at its own expense and control, take steps to defend or enforce any patent within the PATENT RIGHTS and recover, for its own account, any damages, awards or settlements
resulting therefrom, subject to the consent of LICENSEE, such consent not being reasonably withheld. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">9.4 Notwithstanding the foregoing,

which would limit the authority of the Attorney General of North Carolina. </P>
