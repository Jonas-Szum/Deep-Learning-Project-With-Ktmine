Allowable Expense of defending such claim, suit, or proceeding brought by a Third Party alleging that a Licensed Compound and/or the Manufacturing Process (which Manufacturing Process Abbott has not modified in any substantial part pertinent to the
asserted claims in said proceeding) infringe one or more patents Controlled by the Third Party. Such deduction shall be applied in a given Calendar Quarter from sales-based milestones and to the extent not exhausted within an [&#133;***&#133;]

Section&nbsp;7.4 shall be applied as follows: such recovery shall be applied first to (i)&nbsp;reimburse Abbott for its reasonable out-of-pocket costs of defending such claim, suit, or proceedings to the extent not deducted from sales-based
milestones pursuant to the previous sentence, and (ii)&nbsp;reimburse Galapagos for sales-based milestones deductions pursuant to the previous sentence. The balance of any such recoveries shall be retained or provided to Abbott and included in

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Abbott Park, Illinois and Mechelen, Belgium XX DATE 2012 &#150; Abbott (NYSE: ABT) and Galapagos (Euronext: GLPG) announced today that they have entered into
a global collaboration to develop and commercialize an oral, next-generation JAK1 inhibitor with the potential to treat multiple autoimmune diseases. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">GLPG0634 is a highly selective JAK1 inhibitor that Galapagos is developing for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other inflammatory conditions.
The Janus kinases (JAK) are a family of enzymes that play a key role in the signaling mechanism used by a number of cytokines that are involved in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. In previously reported results from a 4-week Phase IIa study,
GLPG0634 demonstrated efficacy measures among the best reported in RA. All patients completed the study, and few experienced any side effects. No anemia, change in blood pressure or lipids were observed. An additional Phase IIa dose-range finding
study with GLPG0634 is expected to begin shortly. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;The addition of this novel, oral compound offers patients the potential for advanced treatment
options and an improved patient experience to address RA and other autoimmune diseases,&#148; said John Leonard, M.D., senior vice president, global research and development, Abbott. &#147;Abbott&#146;s expertise in immunology, combined with a
robust portfolio of investigational treatments represents promising innovation across several areas of medical need.&#148; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;This collaboration with
Abbott, the global leader in inflammatory diseases, is a great recognition of the value of GLPG0634. We view Abbott to be the best partner possible to deliver a complete clinical program and a powerful market introduction. We are excited to continue
the phase II trials and expect to deliver to Abbott a complete Phase II package in 2014,&#148; said Onno van de Stolpe, chief executive officer, Galapagos. &#147;With GLPG0634 we have proven that we can deliver from target to clinical Proof of
Concept, and we aim to do the same on many novel target programs in our pipeline. This collaboration is transformational for Galapagos, providing the means to progress these innovative products into the clinic.&#148; </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the terms of the agreement, Abbott will make an initial upfront payment of $150 million for rights related to the global collaboration. Upon successful
completion of the RA Phase II studies, Abbott will license the program for a one-time fee of $200 million if the studies meet certain pre-agreed criteria. Abbott will assume sole responsibility for Phase III clinical development and global
manufacturing. Pending achievement of certain developmental, regulatory, commercial and sales-based milestones, Galapagos would be eligible to receive additional milestone payments from Abbott, potentially amounting to $1.0 billion, in addition to
tiered double-digit royalties on net sales upon commercialization. Galapagos retains co-promotion rights in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. </P>
