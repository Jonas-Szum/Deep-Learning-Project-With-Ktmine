<P style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:16px; text-indent:-2px; font-size:12pt" align=justify><U>Contribution. &nbsp;</U>If the indemnification provided for in Section 11 is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless each of the indemnified parties against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then the indemnifying party shall, in lieu of indemnifying each party entitled to indemnification hereunder, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified parties on the other in connection with the statements or omissions or alleged statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses. The relative fault of such persons shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact, or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, relates to information supplied by or concerning the indemnifying party on the one hand, or by such indemnified person on the other, and such person's relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 10.4(e) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in this Section. &nbsp;No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation within the meaning of the Securities Act shall be entitled to contribution from any person that is not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.</P>
