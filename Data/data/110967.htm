Seller pursuant to this Agreement, Purchaser agrees that Seller shall have the right to obtain and retain, and to unilaterally instruct the Escrow Agent to deliver to Seller, the Earnest Money as liquidated damages to recompense Seller for time
spent, labor and services performed, and the loss of its bargain. Purchaser and Seller agree that it would be impracticable or extremely difficult to affix damages if Purchaser so defaults and that the Earnest Money, together with the interest
thereon, represents a reasonable estimate of Seller&#146;s damages. Seller agrees to accept the Earnest Money as Seller&#146;s total damages and relief hereunder if Purchaser defaults in an obligation hereunder. If Purchaser does so default, this
Agreement shall be terminated and Purchaser shall have no further right, title, or interest in or to the Target Interest. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>12.2</B>

extent permitted by law, Purchaser hereby waiving the right to bring suit at any later date. As a condition precedent to any suit for specific performance, Purchaser must have tendered to the Escrow Agent all of its deliveries on or before the
Closing Date. Purchaser hereby waives any other rights or remedies. This Agreement confers no present right, title or interest in the Target Interest to Purchaser. </P>
