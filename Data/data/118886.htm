in no event later than 30 days thereafter, Trican U.S. and Keane Parent shall (i)&nbsp;each prepare and submit a presentation to the Accounting Firm detailing each Party&#146;s complete statement of proposed resolution of the dispute and
(ii)&nbsp;instruct the Accounting Firm, acting as an expert and not an arbitrator attempting to reach an acceptable compromise, to render a decision resolving the matters in dispute, in accordance with GAAP and the applicable terms hereof, including
the Net Working Capital Calculation, within ten days of the submission of such matters to the Accounting Firm. The Accounting Firm shall not assign a value to any item in dispute greater than the greatest value for such item assigned to it by Trican
U.S., on the one hand, or Keane Parent, on the other hand, or less than the smallest value for such item assigned to it by Trican U.S., on the one hand, or Keane Parent, on the other hand. The Accounting Firm shall apply GAAP to the specific items

communications or meetings with the Accounting Firm regarding the matters in dispute without the other Party&#146;s or Parties&#146; prior written consent, and any written communications with the Accounting Firm by any Party shall be

Accounting Firm, bears to the total dollar amount of such remaining disputed items so submitted. All determinations made by the Accounting Firm will be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties (absent fraud). By way of example only, if closing
accounts receivable is the only disputed item submitted to the Accounting Firm, and Trican U.S. claims that closing accounts receivable is $1,000, and Buyer contests only $500 of the amount claimed by Trican U.S., and if the Accounting Firm
