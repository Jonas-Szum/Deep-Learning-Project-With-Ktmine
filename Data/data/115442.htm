for leave from any such court, (c) agrees that it shall not bring any action relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement in any court other than the Chancery Courts in the State of Delaware and the United States District Court for
the District of the State of Delaware, and (d) each of the parties irrevocably consents to service of process by a reputable overnight

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Any statements contained in this press release that do not describe
historical facts may constitute forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995. Any such statements, including but not limited to those relating to results of operations, contained herein are based
on current expectations, but are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially
from expectations. The factors that could cause actual future results to differ materially from current expectations include the
following: risks associated with the continuing weak global economy; risks associated with fluctuations in quarterly operating
results due, among other factors, to the long sales cycle with enterprise customers and the size and timing of large customer orders;
risks associated with acquisitions; the risk that our goodwill resulting from acquisitions may become impaired and require a write-down;
limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls; rapid technological change; Datawatch&rsquo;s dependence on the introduction
of new products and product enhancements and possible delays in those introductions; competition in the software industry generally,
and in the markets for next generation analytics in particular; Datawatch's dependence on its principal products, proprietary software
technology and software licensed from third parties; Datawatch&rsquo;s concentration of customers in the financial sector; risks
associated with international sales and operations; risks associated with indirect distribution channels and co-marketing arrangements,
many of which were only recently established; the adequacy of Datawatch&rsquo;s sales returns reserve; risks associated with a
subscription sales model; Datawatch&rsquo;s dependence on its ability to hire and retain skilled personnel; disruption or failure
of Datawatch&rsquo;s technology systems that may result from a natural disaster, cyber-attack, security breach or other catastrophic
event; and uncertainty and additional costs that may result from evolving regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure.
Further information on factors that could cause actual results to differ from those anticipated is detailed in various publicly-available
documents, which include, but are not limited to, filings made by Datawatch from time to time with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, including but not limited to, those appearing in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September
