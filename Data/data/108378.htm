<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Cambridge, Mass., March&nbsp;12, 2015</B> - <U>Epizyme, Inc.</U> (NASDAQ: EPZM), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company creating novel epigenetic
therapeutics for cancer patients, announced today that it has reacquired global rights to its EZH2 program, including <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">EPZ-6438</FONT> from its partner Eisai. Under the terms of the agreement, Epizyme will be solely
responsible for global clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization in all countries outside of Japan, where Eisai will retain rights. EPZ-6438, a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">first-in-class</FONT> inhibitor of EZH2, is currently
being evaluated in a Phase 1/2 clinical study for the treatment of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and INI1-deficient solid tumors, such as synovial sarcoma and malignant rhabdoid tumor. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;Over the past seven years, we have been deliberately building Epizyme as an independent, fully integrated oncology company. Obtaining global control of
EPZ-6438, a very promising clinical asset, represents an important milestone in the evolution of the Company,&#148; said Robert Gould, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer, Epizyme. &#147;As we began to see the quality and duration of the
responses, including two complete responses, in relapsed and refractory NHL and INI1-deficient patients treated with <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">EPZ-6438</FONT> as a monotherapy, it became clear to us that having worldwide development and
commercialization responsibility for a targeted therapeutic like 6438 would be transformative for Epizyme.&#148; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;With the continued emergence of
clinical data on EPZ-6438, it is apparent that this is a therapy with tremendous potential to benefit a variety of patient populations,&#148; said Takashi Owa, Ph.D., Chief Innovation Officer, Eisai Product Creation Systems. &#147;As we <FONT 
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">re-focus</FONT> our resources on our later stage programs across therapeutic areas, we believe that Epizyme is well positioned to move <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">EPZ-6438</FONT> development forward aggressively. We
are pleased that the structure of this agreement allows us to participate in the future success of EPZ-6438.&#148; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Following completion of the transition
of EPZ-6438 from Eisai to Epizyme, Epizyme plans to conduct a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">five-arm</FONT> Phase 2 study in approximately 150 patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This study will evaluate EPZ-6438 in the following patient cohorts:

treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients and patients with INI1-deficient solid tumors. EPZ-6438 is a small molecule inhibitor of EZH2 developed by Epizyme. In many human cancers, misregulated EZH2 enzyme activity results in misregulation of genes
that control cell proliferation&#151;without these control mechanisms, cancer cells are free to grow rapidly. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">EPZ-6438 is the second HMTi to enter human

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Eisai Co., Ltd. (Headquarters: Tokyo, CEO: Haruo Naito, &#147;Eisai&#148;) announced today that Eisai and Epizyme, Inc. (Headquarters: Cambridge,
Massachusetts, CEO: Robert Gould, Ph.D., &#147;Epizyme&#148;) have agreed to change the scope of collaboration for their worldwide partnership initiated in March 2011 to discover, develop and commercialize cancer therapeutics targeting EZH2, an
epigenetic enzyme. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In March 2011, Eisai and Epizyme entered into a collaboration agreement concerning the discovery, development and commercialization of
cancer therapeutics targeting the epigenetic enzyme EZH2 for the treatment of non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma and other cancers. Under this agreement, Eisai has been conducting a Phase I/II clinical study of the EZH2 inhibitor E7438 (Epizyme development
code: EPZ-6438) in patients with advanced solid tumors or non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Eisai and Epizyme have revised the scope of their partnership for
worldwide development and commercialization rights for anticancer therapies targeting EZH2, including E7438, with Epizyme assuming responsibility for development and commercialization in regions outside of Japan and Eisai retaining responsibility
for development and commercialization within Japan as well as having the right of first negotiation for licensing rights in Asia. The decision to change the scope of the partnership was agreed upon by the two companies in consideration of the
priorities of each company&#146;s pipeline strategy and the maximization of the potential value of the compounds including E7438. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Based on this change in
the agreement, Eisai will receive from Epizyme a contractual one-time payment as well as milestone payments as projects progress and marketing authorization is obtained. The companies will pay royalties to one another dependent upon on the sales in
each company&#146;s respective sales regions after launch. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Eisai considers oncology a therapeutic area of focus and is committed to the development of
new anticancer agents and treatments for supportive care. Eisai strives to further contribute to addressing the diverse needs of, and increasing the benefits provided to, patients with cancer and their families. </P>

and plans to commercialize novel epigenetic therapies for cancer patients. Epizyme has built a proprietary product platform that the Company uses to create small molecule inhibitors of enzymes known as histone methyltransferases, or HMTs. HMTs are
part of the system of gene regulation, referred to as epigenetics, that controls gene expression. Genetic alterations can result in changes to the activity of HMTs, making them oncogenic (cancer-causing). By focusing on the genetic drivers of
cancers, Epizyme&#146;s targeted science seeks to match the right medicines with the right patients for a personalized approach to cancer treatment. For more information, visit <U>www.epizyme.com</U>. </P>

<TD ALIGN="left" VALIGN="top"><B>About EZH2 </B></TD></TR></TABLE> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">EZH2 is one of the proteins that make up the histone methyltransferases (HMTs) that alter
gene expression. EZH2 is known to methylate lysine 27 of the protein H3 (H3K27), H3 being one of the five major histone groups (H1, H2A, H2B, H3 and H4) that together help to store DNA in eukaryotic cell nuclei. H3K27 methylation is also known to
suppress gene transcription. It is believed that EZH2 regulates cell proliferation, and may have an important role in carcinogenesis. Also, deletion of the INI1 subunit SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex occurs in nearly all malignant rhabdoid
tumors (MRT), a rare cancer, but with a particularly poor prognosis. An antagonistic relationship has been demonstrated between the biochemical action of the SWI/SNF complex and EZH2 on chromatin, which is relieved in MRT due to the INI1 deletion.
EZH2 may be a potential driving oncogene in these cancers and therefore an important therapeutic target requiring further investigation. Created through Epizyme&#146;s proprietary product platform, E7438 (EPZ-6438) is a first-in-class selective
small molecule inhibitor of the epigenetic enzyme EZH2. Eisai and Epizyme initiated a global strategic partnership in March 2011 regarding the research, development and marketing of EZH2 targeted therapies for lymphomas and other cancers influenced
by these genetic alterations. </P>
