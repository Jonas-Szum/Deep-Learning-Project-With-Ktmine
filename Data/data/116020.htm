2016, Pieris Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) and Pieris Pharmaceuticals GmbH, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (together with the Company, &#147;Pieris&#148;), entered into a license and transfer agreement (the
&#147;Agreement&#148;) with Enumeral Biomedical Holdings, Inc. (&#147;Enumeral&#148;), pursuant to which Pieris acquired a non-exclusive (except in the exclusive field described below) worldwide license to use specified patent rights and know-how
owned by Enumeral to research, develop and market fusion proteins consisting of PD-1 antibodies linked to one or more Anticalin proteins for use in the oncology area. Enumeral also agreed not to practice or assist third parties in practicing in the
exclusive field, consisting of licensed antibodies fused to Anticalin proteins in the oncology area.</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the Agreement, Pieris agreed to pay Enumeral an
upfront license fee of $250,000 and, on May&nbsp;31, 2016, a $750,000 maintenance fee.&nbsp;Under the initial license, Pieris also agreed to pay to Enumeral development milestones of up to an aggregate of $37.8 million for all products and
indications and sales milestones of up to an aggregate of $67.5 million for all products and indications.&nbsp;Pieris also agreed to pay Enumeral royalties within a range in the low to lower-middle single digits as a percentage of net sales
depending on the amount of net sales in the applicable years.&nbsp;In the event that Pieris is required to pay a license fee or royalty to any third party related to the licensed products, the royalty payment due to Enumeral shall be reduced by the
amount of such third party fees or payments, up to 50% of the royalty payment for each calendar year due to Enumeral. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the Agreement, Pieris has an
option for twelve months after the date of the Agreement to license from Enumeral one of a specified set of antibodies owned by Enumeral for use in developing such fusion Anticalin proteins for use in the oncology area. If Pieris licenses an
additional antibody pursuant to the option described above, Pieris must pay to Enumeral an additional undisclosed upfront payment, and any resulting fusion protein products will be subject to additional royalties and development and sales milestones
in the same amounts applicable to the fusion proteins linking PD-1 and Anticalins under the initial license.</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The term of the Agreement ends upon the
expiration of the last to expire patent covered under the license.&nbsp;The Agreement may be terminated by Pieris on 30 days&#146; notice and by Enumeral upon 60 days&#146; notice of a material breach by Pieris (or 30 days with respect to a breach
of payment obligations by Pieris), provided that Pieris has not cured such breach and dispute resolution procedures specified in the Agreement have been followed. The Agreement will also automatically terminate if Pieris elects to not make the
maintenance fee payment described above. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The foregoing description of the Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by

of net sales depending on the amount of net sales in the applicable years.&nbsp;In the event that Pieris is required to pay a license fee or royalty to any third party related to the licensed products, the royalty payment due to Enumeral shall be
reduced by the amount of such third party fees or payments, up to 50% of the royalty payment for each calendar year due to Enumeral. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Agreement also

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>CAMBRIDGE, Mass.&#151;April 18, 2016&#151;</B>Enumeral Biomedical Holdings, Inc. (OTCQB: ENUM) (&#147;Enumeral&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;), a
biotechnology company focused on discovering and developing novel antibody-based immunotherapies to help the immune system fight cancer and other diseases, today announced that it has entered into a License and Transfer Agreement (the &#147;License
Agreement&#148;) with Pieris Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Pieris Pharmaceuticals GmbH (collectively, &#147;Pieris&#148;). </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pursuant to the terms and
conditions of the License Agreement, Pieris is licensing from Enumeral specified intellectual property related to Enumeral&#146;s anti-PD-1 antibody program ENUM 388D4 for the potential development and commercialization by Pieris of novel
multispecific therapeutic proteins comprising fusion proteins based on Pieris&#146; Anticalins<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> class of therapeutic proteins and Enumeral antibodies in the field of oncology. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the License Agreement, Pieris has agreed to pay Enumeral a $250,000 initial license fee, and Enumeral is providing Pieris with sequence and related
information for Enumeral&#146;s 388D4 family of anti-PD-1 antibodies. The License Agreement provides that Pieris may continue the license by paying Enumeral an additional maintenance fee in the amount of $750,000 by May&nbsp;31, 2016. In the event
that Pieris does not pay this maintenance fee by May&nbsp;31, 2016, the License Agreement expires and the license granted thereunder automatically terminates. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If Pieris elects to continue the license and pays Enumeral the maintenance fee, the License Agreement provides that Pieris shall also receive an exclusive
twelve-month option to license Enumeral intellectual property related to an additional antibody program on the same terms and conditions as for the ENUM 388D4 family of anti-PD-1 antibodies (the &#147;Subsequent Option&#148;). The antibody subject
to the Subsequent Option will be selected by Pieris from a specified list of antibodies owned by Enumeral. In the event that Pieris exercises the Subsequent Option, Pieris will pay Enumeral an additional undisclosed license fee. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The terms of the License Agreement provide for Pieris to pay Enumeral development milestones of up to an aggregate of $37.8 million upon the achievement of
specified events, as well as net sales milestone payments of up to an aggregate of $67.5 million upon the achievement of specified net sales thresholds. Under the License Agreement, Pieris also agrees to pay Enumeral royalties in the low-to-lower
middle single digits as a percentage of net sales depending on the amount of net sales in the applicable years. In the event that Pieris licenses an additional antibody pursuant to the Subsequent Option, any resulting fusion protein products will be
subject to the same royalties and development and sales milestones applicable to the fusion proteins linking PD-1 and Anticalins under the initial license. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;We are excited that Pieris has decided to work with our antibody sequences, and we are encouraged that
these sequences could become part of a novel class of therapeutic based on Pieris&#146; Anticalin platform,&#148; said Cokey Nguyen, Ph.D., Enumeral&#146;s Vice President of Research and Development. &#147;Enumeral has been able to generate
antibodies using our proprietary platform technology in a very efficient manner, and this transaction is further validation for the Enumeral approach. We look forward to working with Pieris as we pursue our mutual interests under the License
Agreement.&#148; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;Gaining access to Enumeral&#146;s valuable PD-1 antibody IP not only enables Pieris to leverage its antibody-Anticalin
multispecifics capabilities with a cornerstone immune checkpoint inhibitor, but also brings a high level of intra-pipeline synergy, including with Pieris&#146; lead CD137 bispecific immune costimulator candidate PRS-343,&#148; commented Pieris
President and CEO, Stephen S. Yoder. &#147;This license gives Pieris an opportunity to independently develop anti-PD-1 antibody-Anticalin multispecific immune checkpoint inhibitors as next generation cancer immunotherapeutics.&#148; </P>
