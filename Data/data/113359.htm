(a &ldquo;<U>Piggyback Notice</U>&rdquo;) to each holder of Warrants hereunder (each, a &ldquo;<U>Shareholder</U>&rdquo;) at least
five (5) days before the anticipated filing date. The Piggyback Notice shall describe the number of shares to be registered and
the intended method of distribution and offer each Shareholder the opportunity to register pursuant to such Registration Statement
such shares of Common Stock issued upon exercise of the Warrant held by such Shareholder (the &ldquo;<U>Registrable Shares</U>&rdquo;)
as such Shareholder may request in writing to the Purchaser within five (5) days after the date such Shareholder first received
the Piggyback Notice (a &ldquo;<U>Piggyback Registration</U>&rdquo;). The foregoing Piggyback Registration rights shall be subject
ratably (amongst the Shareholders) to potential underwriter&rsquo;s limitations or cutbacks set forth herein. The Purchaser shall
take reasonable steps to include in the Registration Statement the Registrable Shares which the Purchaser has been so requested
to register by the Shareholders. The Purchaser shall be entitled to suspend or withdraw a Registration Statement prior to its becoming
effective, whether or not any Shareholders have elected to include Registrable Shares in such Registration Statement. If the Registration
Statement is being filed in connection with an underwritten offering and the managing underwriter with respect to such an offering
advises the Purchaser in writing that the inclusion of all or any portion of the Registrable Shares which the Shareholders have
requested to be included in the Registration Statement would materially jeopardize the success of the offering, then the Purchaser
shall be required to include in the underwriting only that number of Registrable Shares which the underwriter advises the Purchaser
in writing may be sold without materially jeopardizing the offering. Any cut back of shares included in the Registration Statement
will apply, first, to the Shareholders and will be pro rata among Shareholders who have elected to have shares included in the
Registration Statement according to the number of Registrable Shares held by each; second, to the shareholders of the Purchaser
entitled to registration rights prior to the date hereof and who have elected to have shares included in the Registration Statement;
and third, to any shares to be offered by the Purchaser therein. Any shares so excluded or withdrawn from such underwriting shall
be excluded and withdrawn from the registration. In any underwritten offering, each Shareholder participating in such offering
shall, as a condition to the inclusion of such Shareholder&rsquo;s Registrable Shares in the offering, enter into an underwriting
agreement in customary form with the representative of the underwriter or underwriters selected by the Purchaser. If the any Shareholder
disapproves of the terms of any such underwriting, it may elect to withdraw its Registrable Shares from such offering by written
notice to the Purchaser and the underwriter, delivered at least five (5) days prior to the effective date of the Registration Statement.
Each Shareholder also agrees to be subject to any lock-up agreements reasonably requested by a managing underwriter and to any
other limitations on the resale of securities or use of the Registration Statement agreed by the participants in the offering who
are not Shareholders. All costs of Purchaser of the registrations referenced herein shall be at the Purchaser&rsquo;s sole expense
(the holders of Warrants, or Common Stock issued upon exercise thereof, shall be responsible for any costs and expenses they may
incur in participating in any such registration).</P>

Indemnification</U>. The Company covenants and agrees to indemnify, defend, protect and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties from,
against and in respect of all Losses that may be suffered, sustained, incurred or paid by any Indemnified Party, whether or not
involving a third party claim, in each case in connection with, resulting from or arising out of, directly or indirectly: (i) the
inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty made by the Company in this Agreement or in any other agreement or other
document delivered in connection with this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; (ii) the non-fulfillment
or breach of any covenant or agreement on the part of the Company in this Agreement or in any other agreement or other document
delivered in connection with this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; (iii) the existence of,
or the failure of the Company to pay, perform or discharge when due, any Liability; (iv) any Excluded Asset; (v) any act or omission
of the Company or any Representative of the Company on or prior to the Closing Date; (vi) any and all Liabilities resulting from
any litigation, suit, proceeding, action, claim, demand or investigation pending or threatened related to the ownership or use

Assets on or prior to the Closing Date or the operation of the Business on or prior to the Closing Date; (ix) any and all Liabilities
in connection with or arising out of the employment or engagement, or termination of employment or engagement, of any person employed
or engaged by the Company at any time, any act or omission of the Company prior to the Closing Date which by virtue of the TUPE
Regulations is deemed to be an act or omission of the Purchaser or in relation to which liability transfers to the Purchaser, and
any claim relating to either Party&rsquo;s failure to comply with its obligations to inform and/or consult under the TUPE Regulations;
and (x) enforcing the Indemnified Party&rsquo;s rights hereunder. The indemnification provided hereunder will terminate twenty
one (21) days after publication of the liquidator&rsquo;s notice to creditors published in the London Gazette so long as the Company
has complied with <U>Section 5.4</U>, provided that indemnification shall survive with respect to any claims arising prior to such
date to the extent such claim is made on or before such date.</P>

Procedures</U>. In the event of the assertion or commencement by any Person of any claim or legal proceeding (whether against the
Purchaser or against any other Person) with respect to which any Indemnified Party may be entitled to indemnification pursuant
to this <U>ARTICLE VII</U>, the Purchaser shall have the right, at its election, to proceed with the defense (including settlement
or compromise) of such claim or legal proceeding on its own; provided, however, that if the Purchaser settles or compromises any
such claim or legal proceeding without the consent of the Company, such settlement or compromise shall not be conclusive evidence
of the amount of Losses incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with such claim or legal proceeding (it being understood
that if the Purchaser requests that the Company consent to a settlement or compromise, the Company shall act reasonably in determining
whether to provide such consent). The Purchaser shall give the Company prompt notice after it becomes aware of the commencement
of any such claim or legal proceeding; provided, however, that any failure on the part of the Purchaser to so notify the Company
shall not limit any of the obligations of the Company, or any of the rights of any Indemnified Party, under this <U>ARTICLE VII</U>
(except to the extent that such failure materially adversely prejudices the defense of such claim or legal proceeding). If the
Purchaser does not elect to proceed with the defense of any such claim or legal proceeding, the Company may proceed with the defense
of such claim or legal proceeding with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser; provided, however, that the Company may
not settle or compromise any such claim or legal proceeding without the prior written consent of the Purchaser (which consent may
not be unreasonably withheld). No Indemnified Party (other than the Purchaser or any successor thereto or assign thereof) shall
be permitted to assert any indemnification claim or exercise any other remedy under this Agreement unless the Purchaser (or any
successor thereto or assign thereof) shall have consented to the assertion of such indemnification claim or the exercise of such
other remedy. Nothing herein shall be deemed to prevent an Indemnified Party from making a claim hereunder, and an Indemnified
Party may make a claim hereunder, for potential or contingent claims or demands, provided, however, that the notice of such claim
shall set forth the basis for any such potential or contingent claim or demand to the extent then reasonably feasible.</P>
