the part of PGen to timely furnish all materials pursuant to Sections 2(a)(1),

in dispute and request the appointment of an arbitration panel. The arbitration 
panel will consist of one arbitrator named by S2C, one arbitrator named by PGen 
and a third arbitrator named by the two arbitrators so chosen. The arbitration 
hearing will be conducted in accordance with the procedural rules set forth in 
the JAMS/Endispute Streamlined Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures. The site of
