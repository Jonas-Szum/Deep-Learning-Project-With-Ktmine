Company Limited announced today that they have entered into an agreement to mutually terminate the February 2011 license agreement covering Intra-Cellular Therapies&#146; proprietary compound ITI-214 and related PDE 1 inhibitors and to return the
rights for these compounds to Intra-Cellular Therapies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the terms of the agreement, Intra-Cellular Therapies has regained all
worldwide development and commercialization rights for the compounds previously licensed to Takeda. Takeda will be responsible for transitioning the compounds back to Intra-Cellular Therapies and will not participate in future development or
commercialization activities. After transition of the program, Intra-Cellular Therapies plans to continue the clinical development of PDE1 inhibitors for the treatment of central nervous system, cardiovascular and other disorders. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;We are grateful for Takeda&#146;s substantial efforts in advancing this program into clinical development,&#148; said Dr.&nbsp;Sharon
Mates, Chairman and CEO of Intra-Cellular Therapies. &#147;This provides us with the opportunity to unify our PDE1 platform and we look forward to continuing the development of ITI-214 and our other PDE1 inhibitors.&#148; </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">PDE1 inhibitors are unique, orally available, investigational drug candidates being developed for the treatment of cognitive impairments
accompanying schizophrenia, Alzheimer&#146;s disease and other neuropsychiatric disorders and neurological diseases and may also treat patients with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Parkinson&#146;s disease. These compounds may also have
the potential to improve motor dysfunction associated with these conditions and may also have the potential to treat patients with multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune diseases and pulmonary arterial hypertension. These compounds are very
selective for the PDE1 subfamily relative to other PDE subfamilies. They have no known significant off target activities at other enzymes, receptors or ion channels. </P>
