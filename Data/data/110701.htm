<p style="margin: 0px;" align="center">(CanaCard Patient Management System)</p>
<p style="margin: 0px;">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px;">The CanaCard Patient Management System ("CPMS" or "CanaCard") provides a platform that manages the end-to-end transactions involved in providing safe access to Medical Cannabis (MC). The CanaCard platform employs a unique patient identification code to access an SQL database designed to securely store personal data, account balances, transactional volume, research data and patient management tools. The database is ONLY accessible to registered patients, certified and registered doctors and the <u style="line-height: 1;">Licensed Provider and/or Dispensary </u>("dispensary") . Through a patient feedback system, doctors are able to monitor individual patient's progress, allowing enhanced treatment recommendations and comparisons between prescribed treatment and patient-reported outcomes to improve future care.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px;">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px;" align="center"><img src="ngey_ex102001.jpg" ></p>
<p style="margin: 0px;">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px;">The CanaCard platform is a <i>Doctor-Patient-Licensed Provider (dispensary) </i>interface that provides a HIPAA compliant, safe, secure and accurate third-Party medical and financial reporting mechanism for all stakeholders in the medical care environment. The system is designed to prevent third-party fraud, and will track ALL transactions and dynamically create medical, financial, tax and other key reports for all approved stakeholders.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: center; margin: 0px;"><strong>CANACARD IS COMPOSED OF FOUR MODELS</strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0px;">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px;">The CanaCard is a patent-pending, closed-network system that connects the 4 key stakeholders: 1) regulator; 2) doctor; 3) dispensary; and 4) patient. The CanaCard itself, a credit card-sized identification card, is an integral part of the CanaCard system that allows the patient password protected online access to their personal health data within the system. Once activated, the card is used to select, purchase and take delivery of all medical cannabis requirements as recorded on a prescription.</p>

<p style="margin: 0px;"><strong><u style="line-height: 1;">Doctor Portal:</u></strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0px;">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px;">In standard practice, the doctor assesses the patient, provides a recommendation and, if necessary, writes a prescription. In the CanaCard system the doctor registers a patient, a diagnosis is documented using built-in International Classification of Disease (lCD) codes (used in billing by insurance companies) and if required, a prescription is recorded. The information is sent automatically and stored permanently in CanaCard&#8217;s secure cloud-based storage. With minimal training, the CanaCard system will allow a doctor to engage in ongoing monitoring and management of patient usage as well as adjust recommendations based on the patient-reported experience and emerging scientific information. The system also provides clinical support to doctors by offering online access to other MC experts. The CanaCard provides a comprehensive medical record, fully HIPAA -HITECH compliant that can seamlessly integrate with, and pull information from, existing Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems for reduced burden of data entry and reduced risk of error.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px;">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px;"><strong><u style="line-height: 1;">Patient Portal:</u></strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0px;">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px;">The patient initially completes an online profile containing standard information and, once registered, diagnosed, and provided with a prescription, the patient can access the dispensary website to fill the prescription. CanaCard provides an easy-to-use payment engine that enables credit card purchases from dispensary websites for a safe, secure transaction and delivery. The CanaCard can be used for online refills as well, but, unlike ordinary refills, the patient is required to complete standard health questions that are recorded and used by the doctor to monitor and manage usage. This feedback and monitoring is a critical quality assurance mechanism. Also, unlike traditional health systems, CanaCard allows the patient to review their own personal health information.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px;">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px;"><strong><u style="line-height: 1;">Licensed Provider I Dispensary Portal:</u></strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0px;">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px;">The dispensary portal offers a customizable web-based sales platform that allows producers to monitor product availability and sales. This website also allows dispensaries to inform patients, doctors, and regulators about their products (e.g., strains, quantities, and pricing) . CanaCard provides the dispensary with an inventory, shipping and handling management system with automated reporting of financial and physical requirements for quality control purposes. The system directly interfaces with a HIPAA compliant patient management screen to facilitate patient ordering and online customer support for VISA, MasterCard, Amex, ATM Debit and Cash transactions. Finally, the registration and tracking process within the CanaCard system protects the dispensary from third party fraud.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px;">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px;"><strong><u style="line-height: 1;">Public Health </u><u style="line-height: 1;">I Regulator Portal:</u></strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0px;">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin: 0px;">The CanaCard system allows regulators, if they wish, to review transactions at a doctor, dispensary and/or patient level, in a HIPAA compliant and protected environment. It also allows for dynamic communication with patients to alert them to Public Safety concerns (via protected email). A significant benefit of the CanaCard system is the capacity for applied research. Large-scale data that can be linked to health information can offer important opportunities for evidence-based practice, evidence-informed policy as well as cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analysis. The information data base that will be created will provide information based on product, as opposed to patient, identity and will be used in the aggregate to support research into improving the effectiveness of medical cannabis in the care and control of many chronic conditions currently afflicting patients of all ages.</p>
