without limitation, any individual, corporation, company, partnership, limited liability company or group, that directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by or is under common control with either Buyer or
Seller, as applicable; provided, however, that a fifty percent (50%)&nbsp;or less owned entity shall not be deemed an Affiliate of Seller. All purchases under this Agreement are subject to issuance of firm purchase orders (&#147;POs&#148; or

calendar year, POs for its entire forecasted purchase from Seller of Components for such given calendar year (the &#147;October Orders&#148;). Buyer agrees that, to the extent practicable, delivery dates requested in POs will be dates that create a
