BioPharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: EIGR) announced today that it has licensed Pegylated Interferon Lambda-1a (&#147;Lambda&#148;), a novel, well-characterized, first in class Type III interferon to be studied as an investigational therapy for
hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection, from Bristol-Myers Squibb. Lambda has been administered in clinical trials involving over 3,000 subjects. It has not been approved for any indication. Eiger plans to evaluate Lambda as a potential monotherapy
and combination treatment for chronic HDV infection, the most aggressive and deadly form of human viral hepatitis. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;We are very excited to execute
this license with Bristol-Myers Squibb.&nbsp;The addition of Lambda to our pipeline is a significant step toward building a leading HDV franchise,&#148; said David Cory, President and CEO of Eiger. &#147;There is no approved therapy for HDV. Along
with Lonafarnib, our Phase 2 candidate for the treatment of HDV, Eiger has established a strategic position with the addition of Lambda. Eiger will leverage existing relationships with clinical investigators and clinical sites for efficient
exploration of Lambda alone or in combination with other agents toward an approved therapy for HDV.&#148; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;Most cells in the body express the
receptor for interferon alpha, a Type I interferon. However, receptors for Lambda, a Type III interferon, are expressed on liver cells, a desirable location for treating viral hepatitis, but less so on some blood cells and non-liver cells. Lambda
represents a promising and potentially better tolerated interferon therapy for HDV,&#148; said Eduardo Martins, MD, DPhil, Senior Vice President of Liver and Infectious Diseases at Eiger. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The exclusive worldwide license from Bristol-Myers Squibb involved an upfront payment and the issuance of Eiger Common Stock and includes development and
regulatory milestones through first commercial sale in the US, EU, and Japan and milestone payments based on commercial sales achievement as well as tiered annual net sales royalties. </P>

well-characterized, late-stage, orally active inhibitor of farnesyl transferase, an enzyme involved in modification of proteins through a process called prenylation. HDV uses this host cell process inside liver cells to complete a key step in its
life cycle. Lonafarnib inhibits the prenylation step of HDV replication inside liver cells and blocks the virus life cycle at the stage of assembly.&nbsp;Since prenylation is carried out by a host enzyme, this compound may present a higher barrier
to development of viral resistance mutations to therapy.&nbsp;Lonafarnib has been dosed in over 100 HDV-infected patients across international academic centers and is in </P>

Phase 2 development for HDV.&nbsp;Lonafarnib has been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA), and Fast Track

Hepatitis D) is caused by infection with HDV and is considered to be one of the most severe forms of viral hepatitis in humans.&nbsp;Hepatitis D occurs only as a co-infection in individuals harboring Hepatitis B Virus (HBV).&nbsp;Hepatitis D leads
to more severe liver disease than HBV alone and is associated with accelerated liver fibrosis, liver cancer, and liver failure. Hepatitis D is a disease with a significant impact on global health, which may affect up to approximately
15-20&nbsp;million people worldwide.&nbsp;The prevalence of HDV varies among different parts of the world.&nbsp;Globally, HDV infection is reported to be present in approximately 4.3% to 5.7% of chronic Hepatitis B carriers.&nbsp;The prevalence of
HDV in patients infected with chronic HBV is even higher in certain regions, including certain parts of Mongolia, China, Russia, Central Asia, Pakistan, Turkey, Africa, and South America, with an HDV prevalence as high as 60% being reported in
HBV-infected patients in Mongolia and Pakistan. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>About Eiger </B></P>
