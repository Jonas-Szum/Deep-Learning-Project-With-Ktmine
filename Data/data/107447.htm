of a facsimile machine or other electronic transmission, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original agreement and shall be considered to have the same binding legal effects as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered
in person. At the request of any Party, the other Party shall re-execute original forms thereof and deliver them to the requesting Party. No Party shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or other electronic means to deliver a signature or the
fact that any signature was transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or other electronic means as a defense to the formation of a Contract and each such Party forever waives any such defense. </P>
