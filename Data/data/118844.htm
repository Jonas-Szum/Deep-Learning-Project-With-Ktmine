company with expertise in innovative treatments for cardiovascular diseases , and Miragen Therapeutics, Inc., a preclinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on improving patients&#146; lives by developing innovative microRNA (miRNA)-based
therapeutics for cardiovascular and muscle disease, announced today an agreement for advancing the research, development and commercialization of three cardiovascular targets, including two of miRagen&#146;s lead programs (miR-208 and miR-15/195)
and one additional target yet to be identified. This partnership provides worldwide rights, excluding the U.S. and Japan, to Servier. </P>

over the next three years, as well as royalties on sales, based on the successful outcome of the collaboration. Additional clinical and commercial milestones, as well as clinical development support for the successful development of the three
compounds, would value the deal at approximately $1 billion. Miragen and Servier will collaborate on the research and development effort, while Servier alone will be responsible for all costs associated with the global development, </P>

demonstrated leadership and expertise in the development of cardiovascular drugs are truly impressive. By combining our strengths, we hope to translate the potential of microRNA targeting into life-changing medicines for patients in need.&#148; </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>About microRNAs:</B> MicroRNAs have emerged as an important class of small RNAs encoded in the genome. They act to control the expression of sets of genes
and entire pathways and are thus thought of as master regulators of gene expression. Recent studies have demonstrated that microRNAs are associated with many disease processes. Because they are single molecular entities that dictate the expression
of fundamental regulatory pathways, microRNAs represent potential drug targets for controlling many biologic and disease processes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>About Servier</B>:
