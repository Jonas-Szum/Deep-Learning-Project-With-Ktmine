participating in a potential or actual investment, loan, acquisition, license or collaboration. The Parties will consult with one another and use reasonable efforts to agree on the provisions of this Agreement to be redacted in any filings required
to be made by either Party with the Securities and Exchange Commission or as otherwise required by law, provided that each Party shall have the right to make any required disclosures as it deems necessary in order to comply with applicable laws and
