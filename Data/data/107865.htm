<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">DuraSite is a sustained delivery technology using a synthetic polymer-based formulation designed to extend the time of a drug in the eye relative to
conventional topical therapies. This is important because the eye&#146;s drainage system is extremely efficient at eliminating topically instilled medications and often results in up to 90% of the administered drug being lost in the first 15-30
seconds after delivery<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">2</SUP>. The increased time that DuraSite<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">&reg;</SUP> remains in the eye allows lower concentrations of a drug to be administered over
a longer period of time. This provides more convenient dosing, reduces the potential of adverse side effects, and may lead to improved patient compliance. </P>

novel ophthalmic therapeutics through Phase 3 clinical studies for the treatment of eye infections, and is preparing two new drug applications (NDA) for the commercial approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA): BromSite&#153; for the

Insite, the assignee of all the named inventors. The United States Patent and Trademark Office entered their judgment against UCSF&#146;s claim in November 2011, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has affirmed that judgment. On
