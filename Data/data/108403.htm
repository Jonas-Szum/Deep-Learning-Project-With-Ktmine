their respective successors and assigns, together with their respective current and former officers, directors, partners, shareholders, employees, and agents (collectively, and with the Company, the &#147;<U>Group</U>&#148;), from any and all claims
whatsoever up to the date hereof that I had, may have had, or now have against the Group, whether known or unknown, for or by reason of any matter, cause, or thing whatsoever, including any claim arising out of or attributable to my employment or
the termination of my employment with the Company, whether for tort, breach of express or implied employment contract, intentional infliction of emotional distress, wrongful termination, unjust dismissal, defamation, libel, or slander, or under any
federal, state, or local law dealing with discrimination based on age, race, sex, national origin, handicap, religion, disability, or sexual orientation. The release of claims in this Release includes, but is not limited to, all claims arising under
the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (&#147;<U>ADEA</U>&#148;), Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, the Employee

other purported restriction on an employer&#146;s right to terminate the employment of employees. I intend this Release to be a general release of any and all claims to the fullest extent permissible by law and for the provisions regarding the
release of claims against the Group to be construed as broadly as possible, and hereby incorporate in this release similar federal, state or other laws, all of which I also hereby expressly waive. </P>

hereafter be discovered, but it is my intention to fully and forever release, remise and discharge all claims which I had, may have had, or now have against the Group, whether known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, asserted or unasserted,
contingent or noncontingent, without regard to the subsequent discovery or existence of such additional or different facts. Without limiting the foregoing, by signing this Release, I expressly waive and release any provision of law that purports to
