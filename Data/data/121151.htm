Nothing contained in this Agreement shall constitute an agreement to transfer and assign any Transferred Agreement or any right
thereunder if an attempted transfer and assignment without the consent of a third party would constitute a breach or in any way
adversely affect the rights of DanDrit or OS thereto. OS and DanDrit will, following the Signing Date, use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the consent of the other parties to any such Transferred Agreement for the transfer and assignment thereof to
DanDrit. If the assignment or transfer of any agreement referred to above would constitute a breach or default under such agreement
by reason of the failure of OS to obtain the required consent of any party to such agreement to such assignment and transfer,
then the assignment and transfer to DanDrit and the assumption by DanDrit of such agreement shall be deemed to have been made
contingent upon, and shall take effect only upon, the obtaining of such required consent. If such consent is not obtained prior
to Closing, OS shall remain a party to such Transferred Agreement and DanDrit shall, acting on behalf of OS, perform all obligations
under such Transferred Agreement and indemnify and hold harmless OS in respect thereof, solely with respect to such obligations
to be performed after Closing, and OS shall deliver to DanDrit all rights, including, without limitation, all consideration, under
such Transferred Agreement to DanDrit, and OS and DanDrit will cooperate in a mutually agreeable arrangement under which DanDrit
will obtain the benefits and assume the obligations thereunder in accordance with the Agreement, including sub-contracting, sub
licensing, or sub leasing to DanDrit, if such actions are permitted under the applicable agreement. OS shall, when entering into
any material agreement during the period between the Signing Date and Closing, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
approval of the respective counterparty of an assignment as of the Closing to DanDrit of such agreement. If consent to assignment
of any Transferred Agreement shall not be obtained or if any attempted assignment of a Transferred Agreement would be ineffective
or would impair DanDrit&rsquo;s rights so that DanDrit would not in effect acquire the benefit of all such rights, the obligation
of the parties to perform this Agreement, including the Closing, shall not be affected.</P>
