<U>Saving Provision</U>. The Company and Consultant agree and stipulate that the agreements set out in Section&nbsp;2 above are fair and reasonably necessary for the protection of the business, goodwill, confidential information, and other
protectable interests of the Company in light of all of the facts and circumstances of the relationship between Consultant and the Company. In the event a court of competent jurisdiction should decline to enforce those provisions, they shall be
deemed to be modified to restrict Consultant to the maximum extent which the court shall find enforceable; however, in no event shall the above provisions be deemed to be more restrictive to Consultant than those contained herein. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">3.2 <U>Injunctive Relief</U>. Consultant acknowledges that the breach or threatened breach of any of the nondisclosure or nonsolicitation
covenants contained herein would give rise to irreparable injury to the Company, which injury would be inadequately compensable in money damages. Accordingly, the Company may seek and obtain a restraining order and/or injunction prohibiting the
breach or threatened breach of any provision, requirement or covenant of this Agreement, in addition to and not in limitation of any other legal remedies which may be available. Consultant further acknowledges and agrees that the agreements set out
above are necessary for the protection of the Company&#146;s legitimate goodwill and business interests and are reasonable in scope and content. </P>

contained in any provision hereof may be waived, only in accordance with this Section. No waiver by either party or any breach by the other or any provision hereof shall be deemed to be a waiver of any later or other breach thereof or as a waiver of
any other provision of this Agreement. This Agreement may not be waived, changed, discharged or terminated orally or by any course of dealing between the parties, but only by an instrument in writing signed by the party against whom any waiver,
change, discharge is sought or by the party notifying of termination of this Agreement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">3.7 <U>No Assignment</U>. This Agreement may not

with the transactions contemplated hereby for any reason shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement or such other
