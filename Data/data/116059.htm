to allocate the Purchase Price to be paid in respect of the Assigned Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code. The
Parties agree that Assignee shall prepare and provide to Assignor a draft allocation of the Purchase Price among the Assigned
Assets within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date. Assignor shall notify Assignee within thirty (30) days of receipt of
such draft allocation of any objection Assignor may have thereto. Unless Assignor delivers a notice of objection with respect
to the allocation of the Purchase Price by the conclusion of such thirty (30) day period, the draft allocation provided by
Assignee to Assignor pursuant to the second sentence of this <U>Section 2.9</U> shall become final and binding upon the
Parties. The Parties agree to resolve any disagreement with respect to such allocation in good faith. If a resolution of such
disagreement has not been effected within fifteen (15) days (or longer, as mutually agreed by the Parties) after delivery of
an objection by Assignor, then either Party may submit such disagreement to an arbitrator (chosen by mutual consent of
the Parties) for determination. The determination of the arbitrator with respect to any such disagreement shall be completed

(50%) of the costs and expenses of the arbitrator incurred pursuant to this <U>Section 2.9</U>. In addition, the Parties
hereby agree to file timely any information that may be required to be filed pursuant to Treasury Regulations promulgated
under Section 1060(b) of the Code in a manner that is consistent with the allocation determined pursuant to this <U>Section
2.9</U> in connection with the preparation of IRS Form 8594 and any other forms, reports, or information statements required
to be filed pursuant to Section 1060 of the Code and the applicable Treasury Regulations, and any similar or corresponding
provision of state or local tax law. Neither Party shall file any Return or other document or otherwise take any position
which is inconsistent with the allocation determined pursuant to this <U>Section 2.9</U>, except as may be adjusted by
subsequent agreement following an audit by the IRS or by a Judgment; <I>provided</I>, that neither Party (nor their
respective Affiliates) shall be obligated to litigate any challenge to such allocation of the Purchase Price by any
Governmental Entity. The allocation of the Purchase Price shall be revised to take into account subsequent adjustments to the
Purchase Price in the manner provided by Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder and consistent with
the preparation of the Purchase Price allocation hereunder, and the Parties shall cooperate with each other in good faith to
promptly amend the Purchase Price allocation. The Parties shall promptly inform one another of any challenge by any
Governmental Entity to any allocation made pursuant to this <U>Section 2.9</U> and agree to consult with and keep one another
informed with respect to the state of, and any discussion, proposal or submission with respect to, such challenge.</P>

associated therewith, dated as of the date hereof, from Israel Discount Bank (the &ldquo;<B>Lender</B>&rdquo;) providing the terms
and conditions upon which the Lender has committed to provide $35,000,000 (the &ldquo;<B>Debt Financing Proceeds</B>&rdquo;) of
senior debt financing (the &ldquo;<B>Debt Financing</B>&rdquo;). The Debt Commitment Letter in the form so delivered is, as to
Assignee and the other parties thereto, valid and in full force and effect, such commitment has not been withdrawn, terminated
or otherwise amended or modified in any respect, and no event or circumstance has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse
of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Assignee under any term or condition of the Debt Commitment
Letter. The Debt Commitment Letter (together with the fee letter referred to therein) constitutes the entire and complete agreement
between the parties thereto with respect to the financing contemplated thereby, and, except as set forth, described or provided
for in the Debt Commitment Letter, (i) there are no conditions precedent to the obligation of the Lender to provide the Debt Financing
other than as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and (ii) there are no contractual contingencies or other provisions under
any agreement (including any side letters) relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Gaiam-FFL APA to
which Assignee or any of its Affiliates is a party that would permit the Lender to reduce the total amount of the Debt Financing
or impose any additional conditions precedent to the availability of the Debt Financing. Assignee has fully paid any and all commitment
fees, if any, or other fees required by the Debt Commitment Letter to be paid as of the date hereof. As of the date hereof, Assignee
has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Debt Financing will not be satisfied on a timely basis or that the funding
contemplated in the Debt Financing will not be made available to Assignee on a timely basis in order to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Gaiam-FFL APA. The Debt Financing is sufficient to pay the Purchase Price (as defined in
the Gaiam-FFL APA), all other amounts to be paid or repaid by Assignee under this Agreement and the Gaiam-FFL APA (whether payable
on or after the closing of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby), and all of Assignee&rsquo;s and its Affiliates&rsquo;
fees and expenses associated with the transactions contemplated in this Agreement and the Gaiam-FFL APA in accordance with the
terms hereof and thereof. The obligations of Assignee under this Agreement are not contingent on the availability of financing.</P>
