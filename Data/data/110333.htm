STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">FAJARDO, Puerto Rico and BOSTON, Mass., July&nbsp;9, 2007 - Warner Chilcott Company, Inc. and Paratek Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced today that the two companies have entered into an exclusive license
agreement for the development and commercialization of novel, narrow-spectrum tetracyclines for the treatment of acne and rosacea. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT 
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Tetracycline antibiotics are the leading approved systemic treatments of moderate to severe inflammatory acne. Discovered decades ago as broad-spectrum systemic antibiotics, tetracyclines have been shown
to be potent anti-acne agents. Paratek has utilized its expertise in chemistry to develop novel narrow-spectrum antibacterial tetracyclines with improved anti-inflammatory activity, tolerability and other properties for the next generation treatment
of acne and rosacea. These compounds represent the first tetracycline-derived new molecular entities ever to be synthesized specifically as improved therapeutics for dermatologic diseases. </FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">&#147;We look forward to a productive collaboration with Paratek as we work together to progress Paratek&#146;s novel tetracycline
products through the development process and into commercialization&#148; said Roger Boissonneault, Chief Executive Officer and President of Warner Chilcott. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT 
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">&#147;We are pleased to announce our collaboration with Warner Chilcott, a proven leader in the development and commercialization of dermatology products,&#148; said Stuart B. Levy, M.D., <FONT 
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Co-founder</FONT> and Chief Scientific Officer of Paratek Pharmaceuticals. &#147;For years, dermatologists have sought therapies with a more targeted spectrum of activity. While effective, currently marketed tetracyclines
possess antibacterial activity against a broad number of organisms not associated with acne or rosacea, which can lead to adverse consequences such as resistance development among life-threatening bacteria and persistent side effects. Paratek&#146;s
proprietary compounds have been designed to circumvent these issues by better targeting the causative bacteria and retaining potent anti-inflammatory properties.&#148; </FONT></P>

STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Paratek Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is engaged in the discovery and commercialization of new therapeutics that treat serious and life-threatening diseases, with a particular focus on the growing worldwide
problem of antibiotic resistance. Paratek is advancing novel compounds that can circumvent or block bacterial resistance involving technology initially developed by Paratek <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">co-founder</FONT> Dr.&nbsp;Stuart
Levy&#146;s laboratory at Tufts University School of Medicine, and licensed by Paratek. In addition to its tetracycline-derived antibacterials, Paratek is developing small molecule drugs that can prevent infection by interfering with Multiple
Adaptational Response (MAR) mechanisms in bacteria. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Outside the antibacterial therapeutic area, Paratek has also established
an effort to exploit its novel tetracycline derivatives and their unique mechanism of action in selected anti-inflammatory and neurodegenerative conditions. Paratek has an active chemical synthesis effort to produce novel and diverse small
molecules, with the goal of developing <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-antibacterial</FONT> compounds with improved activity in serious inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases based upon a growing body of clinical and basic research
supporting this approach. </FONT></P>
