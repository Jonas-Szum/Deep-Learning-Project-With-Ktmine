(including the scope of the license to be negotiated) for such license or acquisition agreement (such agreement, a &#147;<B>Third Party IP Agreement</B>&#148;). The IPC also may designate one Party, or that the Parties jointly, be responsible for
handling negotiations of a Third Party IP Agreement, but, absent such determination by the Parties to obtain a license or acquire such Third Party IP, or absent a designation by the IPC which Party shall be responsible for handling the negotiations
of a Third Party IP Agreement, MorphoSys shall have the right, at its sole discretion, to negotiate such Third Party IP Agreement for the MorphoSys Territory in accordance with Section 8.5.2(b). The negotiating Party shall have responsibility and

amounts for the MorphoSys Territory (including upfront payments, milestone payments, license fees, royalties or other payments) payable under such Third Party IP Agreement and MorphoSys shall reimburse Emergent [**] percent ([**]%) of such paid
amounts upon Emergent sending an invoice to MorphoSys, which reimbursement amount (other than with respect to arm&#146;s length and good faith negotiated upfront payments, milestone payments and license fees payable under such Third Party IP

Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of such Third Party Claim in accordance with Section 11.3.2, the Indemnifying Party will have authority to consent to the entry of any judgment, enter into any settlement or otherwise dispose of such Loss,

STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">TM </SUP>(modular protein technology) platform. Preclinical <I>in vitro </I>and <I>in vivo </I>studies have shown that MOR209/ES414 redirects T-cell cytotoxicity towards prostate cancer cells expressing
Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA), an antigen commonly found on such cells. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the terms of the agreement, MorphoSys gains worldwide
commercialization rights excluding the U.S. and Canada, where Emergent will retain rights. Emergent will receive an upfront payment of US$20 million and will be eligible to receive potential milestone payments of up to US$163 million. The milestone
payments are linked to specific events, including successful development of MOR209/ES414 in several indications and securing approval in certain territories. MorphoSys and Emergent will jointly develop MOR209/ES414, with MorphoSys bearing 64% and
Emergent 36% of the total costs. Emergent will manufacture and supply clinical material from its manufacturing facilities in Baltimore, Maryland. Emergent will receive low single digit royalties on product sales in MorphoSys&#146;s territory and
MorphoSys will receive tiered royalties from mid-single digit up to 20% on product sales in Emergent&#146;s territory. Additional financial details were not disclosed. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Dr.&nbsp;Arndt Schottelius, Chief Development Officer of MorphoSys, added: &#147;We are pleased to be working with Emergent BioSolutions. We believe
MOR209/ES414 has the potential to be an important therapy for prostate cancer, where there is a pressing need for better treatments. The preclinical data suggest that the molecule has a number of potential advantages over other drug candidates in
this indication. Our goal is to combine our capabilities with those of Emergent to enable the fastest possible development and commercialization of MOR209/ES414.&#148; </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Barry Labinger, Executive Vice President and President Biosciences Division at Emergent BioSolutions, stated: &#147;Emergent looks forward to collaborating

<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>About MOR209/ES414 </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">MOR209/ES414 is a targeted
immunotherapeutic protein, which activates host T cell immunity specifically against prostate cancer cells expressing Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA), an antigen commonly overexpressed on prostate cancer cells. The MOR209/ES414 molecule
was constructed using Emergent&#146;s ADAPTIR technology platform and selectively binds to the T cell receptor on cytotoxic T cells and PSMA on tumor cells. MOR209/ES414 contains two pairs of binding domains, each targeting a unique antigen, linked
to opposite ends of an immunoglobulin Fc domain to extend the half-life and enable use of a purification process typical of lg-based molecules. In preclinical studies, MOR209/ES414 has been shown to redirect T cell cytotoxicity towards prostate
cancer cells expressing PSMA. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">ADAPTIR bispecific proteins are modular, single chain polypeptides that comprise two separate binding domains, a hinge segment, and an effector domain (huFc).
They have a differentiated structure from monoclonal antibodies and can generate a unique signaling response. Some ADAPTIR molecules, like MOR209/ES414, may mediate T cell cytotoxicity by redirecting T cells against tumor cells. In addition,
monospecific ADAPTIR proteins may mediate complement dependent cytotoxicity and Fc dependent cytotoxicity, similar to monoclonal antibodies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">ADAPTIR and

the most common cancer in men with approximately 230,000 new cases annually in the United States or 900,000 new cases annually worldwide. Screening, radiation, surgery and hormone ablation therapy have greatly improved the detection and treatment of
early stage prostate cancer. However, the new therapies only improve life expectancy by a few months for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Emergent BioSolutions and MorphoSys Sign License Agreement to Co-Develop and Commercialize Prostate Cancer Drug Candidate ES414 </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Emergent BioSolutions Inc. (NYSE: EBS) and MorphoSys AG (FSE: MOR; Prime Standard Segment, TecDAX, OTC: MPSYY) today announced an agreement for the joint
development and commercialization of Emergent&#146;s preclinical bi-specific antibody, ES414, targeting prostate cancer. Under the terms of the agreement, Emergent will receive an upfront payment of US$20 million and milestone payments of up to
US$163 million. These milestone payments are linked to specific events, including successful development of ES414 in several indications and securing approval in certain territories. Emergent and MorphoSys will jointly develop ES414, with MorphoSys
bearing 64% and Emergent 36% of the total costs. Emergent will retain commercialization rights in the U.S. and Canada, with a tiered royalty obligation to MorphoSys, from mid-single digit up to 20%. MorphoSys will gain worldwide commercialization
rights excluding the U.S. and Canada, with a low single digit royalty obligation to Emergent. Emergent will manufacture and supply clinical material from its manufacturing facilities in Baltimore, Maryland. Additional financial details were not
disclosed. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I></I>ES414, which will be renamed MOR209/ES414, was developed by Emergent using its proprietary ADAPTIR&#153; (modular protein technology)
platform. Preclinical <I>in vitro </I>and <I>in vivo </I>studies have shown that ES414 redirects T-cell cytotoxicity towards prostate cancer cells expressing Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA), an antigen commonly found on such cells.<I>
</I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Barry Labinger, Executive Vice President and President Biosciences Division at Emergent BioSolutions, stated: &#147;Emergent looks forward to
collaborating with MorphoSys to potentially address important unmet needs amongst patients suffering from prostate cancer. Our companies bring complementary capabilities, compatible cultures and values, and a shared commitment to the highest quality
development and commercialization of ES414. We expect to begin clinical development within the next six months. Progress with ES414 will help validate our ADAPTIR platform, which we believe has broad potential to generate additional novel treatments
for cancer and other important diseases. We are encouraged by our partnership with MorphoSys and the continued interest of multiple parties in our ADAPTIR platform.&#148; </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Arndt Schottelius, Chief Development Officer of MorphoSys, added: &#147;We are pleased to be working with Emergent BioSolutions. We believe ES414 has the
potential to be an important therapy for prostate cancer, where there is a pressing need for better treatments. The preclinical data suggest that the molecule has a number of potential advantages over other drug candidates in this indication. Our
goal is to combine our capabilities with those of Emergent to enable the fastest possible development and commercialization of ES414.&#148; </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Emergent and MorphoSys plan to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating ES414 in patients with metastatic
castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) within the next six months. The initial phase of the trial will be conducted in the U.S. and Australia, with Emergent as the sponsor. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>About ES414 </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">ES414 is a targeted immunotherapeutic
protein, which activates host T-cell immunity specifically against prostate cancer cells expressing Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA), an antigen commonly overexpressed on prostate cancer cells. The ES414 molecule was constructed using
Emergent&#146;s ADAPTIR technology platform and selectively binds to the T cell receptor on cytotoxic T cells and PSMA on tumor cells. ES414 contains two pairs of binding domains, each targeting a unique antigen, linked to opposite ends of an
immunoglobulin Fc domain to extend the half-life and enable use of a purification process typical of lg-based molecules. In preclinical studies, ES414 has been shown to redirect T-cell cytotoxicity towards prostate cancer cells expressing PSMA. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>About the ADAPTIR&#153; Platform </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">ADAPTIR bispecific
proteins are modular, single chain polypeptides that comprise two separate binding domains, a hinge segment, and an effector domain (huFc). They have a differentiated structure from monoclonal antibodies and can generate a unique signaling response.
Some ADAPTIR molecules, like ES414, may mediate T-cell cytotoxicity by redirecting T cells against tumor cells. In addition, monospecific ADAPTIR proteins may mediate complement dependent cytotoxicity and Fc dependent cytotoxicity, similar to
monoclonal antibodies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">ADAPTIR and any and all Emergent BioSolutions Inc. brand, product, service and feature names, logos, and slogans are trademarks or

Cancer </B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men with approximately 230,000 new cases annually in the United States or 900,000 new cases
annually worldwide. Screening, radiation, surgery and hormone ablation therapy have greatly improved the detection and treatment of early stage prostate cancer. However, the new therapies only improve life expectancy by a few months for patients
with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>About Emergent BioSolutions </B></P>
